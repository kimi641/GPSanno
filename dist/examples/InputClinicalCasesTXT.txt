	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis--the spectrum of imaging findings.
	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), also known as Van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the lipid metabolism. To date, there are less than 300 cases reported worldwide. We present a case of a 30 year old male who presented with mental retardation and swelling of ankles, with the a spectrum of CTX imaging findings. Imaging studies were performed which included plain X-ray, Ultrasound(US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of both the brain and ankles. These pointed towards the diagnosis of CTX with the entire spectrum of findings which was confirmed with biopsy and laboratory findings. CTX is a potentially treatable condition with replacement therapy, and hence early diagnosis before neurological deterioration is important. This is aided by the imaging findings which are conclusive forte diagnosis of CTX.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder affecting the biosynthetic pathway of bile acids, leading to increased cholestanol formation and its accumulation in various tissues. Patients can present with tendon xanthomas, gait abnormalities, osteoporosis with or without a pathological fracture, diminished vision, intractable diarrhoea, seizures,ataxia, psychosis, and mental retardation. We report a 20-year-old man who presented with multiple recurrent tendon swellings and seizures. The earlier diagnosis and treatment helps in preventing the devastating neurological sequalae of this sinister condition. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid is crucial in preventing the progression of this rare disorder.

	Neurological outcome in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis treated with chenodeoxycholic acid: early versus late diagnosis.
	OBJECTIVE: To present the long-term neurological outcome of Jewish Israeli patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) after several years of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) treatment. METHODS: A cross sectional observational study of all patients with a diagnosis of CTX followed in a referral outpatient clinic during the years 2003-2012. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (10 men) from 11 families were enrolled. Sixteen patients were included in the analysis (2 patients had low compliance for treatment). The mean ± SD age at last evaluation was 35.0 ± 9.2 years (range, 16-45 years). After their diagnosis, at age 22.6 ± 10.8 years, all patients were treated with CDCA. Patients who started treatment after the age of 25 years had worse outcome and were significantly more limited in ambulation (P = 0.004) and more cognitively impaired (P = 0.047). Five patients who started treatment after 25 years of age continued to deteriorate despite CDCA treatment.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with bilateral achilles tendon xanthomata: a case report.
	Xanthomas are described as deposits in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Mostly known as pseudotumors, xanthomas consist of connective tissue containing mainly cholesterol, triglycerides, and numerous foamy macrophages. Bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomata is pathognomonic for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in the case of normal cholesterol levels but increased cholestanol levels in serum. In this article, we present findings regarding bilateral xanthomas of Achilles tendons in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

	'Hot cross bun' sign in a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare neuroimaging observation.
	We report a 25-year-old young man presenting with cognitive decline, pancerebellar features, spastic quadriparesis, bilateral cataract (operated) and tendo-Achilles swelling (xanthoma). The CT of the head showed bilateral cerebellar hypodensities. There were bilateral cerebellar hypointensities involving dentate nuclei on T1-weighted images with corresponding hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI. Additionally, an interesting MRI finding-'hot cross bun' appearance was seen in pons which has not been reported in the literature so far. Biopsy from tendo-Achilles confirmed xanthoma. He was treated with chenodeoxycholic acid following which he showed improvement in cognition and weakness.

	Juvenile Cataract Morphology in 3 Siblings Not Yet Diagnosed with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis.
	PARTICIPANTS: Four siblings and their 2 parents, who are first cousins. This study highlights the morphology of lens opacities in a family with genetically confirmed disease. RESULTS: Two sisters, each visually symptomatic before 10 years of age, had a unique pattern of bilateral fleck deposits throughout the lens with significant posterior capsular cataract. When initially examined at 8 years of age, their then-asymptomatic younger brother had the same bilateral fleck deposits with minimal posterior capsular opacity; 1 year later, he demonstrated anterior capsular opacity and became symptomatic. Both asymptomatic parents had few but distinct similar flecks localized at or near the anterior Y-suture, whereas an asymptomatic sister did not. Genetic analysis revealed homozygosity for a known CYP27A1 mutation (c.1263+1Gâ†’A) in the 3 symptomatic siblings, heterozygosity for the mutation in the 2 parents, and no mutation in the asymptomatic sister. When specifically questioned, the 3 affected children had experienced recurrent bouts of diarrhea in early childhood, which is a common feature of the disease.

	Long-term bone density evaluation in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: evidence of improvement after chenodeoxycholic Acid treatment.
	We studied 11 CTX patients aged 13-43Â years. We performed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and assessed serum cholestanol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations both at the time of diagnosis and after long-term treatment with CDCA. At baseline, we found low BMD in nine patients, cholestanol elevation in all subjects, and 25-OHD decrease in nine. After a mean follow-up time of 30Â months (range 24-36), no substantial clinical changes including bone fractures occurred; and we detected a significant increase of both planar and volumetric BMD as well as normalization of plasma cholestanol levels and increase of serum 25-OHD. Densitometric improvement following CDCA introduction was not correlated to changes of biochemical parameters. Our study confirms the presence of low bone mass in CTX and demonstrates that long-term CDCA treatment increases bone mineral content. In this respect, improvement of vitamin D intestinal absorption secondary to bile acid restoration could play an important role. Moreover, our

	Myoclonus and dystonia in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	METHODS: We collected clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological, neuroradiological, and genetic data of 6 patients with myoclonus and mild dystonia associated with CTX. RESULTS: Our 6 patients presented distal myoclonus with mild dystonia of the upper limbs. Myoclonus was of subcortical origin, based on neurophysiological recordings, and differed from oromandibular myoclonus previously described in CTX patients.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare disorder with a rare presentation.
	A young man was brought for mental retardation, frequent non-bloody diarrhoea and swellings at ankles and elbow. He became bed-ridden due to cataract, mental retardation and pain in the back and lower limb. There were repeated pathological fractures and vitamin D deficiency without renal dysfunction. There were low low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. MRI of the brain revealed hypointense lesions in cerebellar white matter, heterogenous hyperintensity in dentate nucleus and adjacent white matter, right basal ganglia and in the periventricular region with diffuse cerebral atrophy. T1-weighted MRI (ankle region) revealed bilaterally thickened and irregular achilles tendons with hyperintense masses surrounded by patchy hypointensities. A similar xanthomatous lesion (cholestanol deposits) was also present in the sacral region. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation and chenodeoxycholic acid therapy improved pain at lower limbs and body weight. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal-recessive familial mutation of the sterol 27 hydroxylase causing lipid metabolic disease.

	Polyneuropathy in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and response to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.
	We report clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological findings in 35 CTX patients. Twenty-six subjects (74.2 %) showed peripheral nerve abnormalities. Polyneuropathy was predominantly axonal (76.9 % of patients) and generally mild. No correlation was found between its presence and clinical or biochemical data. In polyneuropathic patients, CDCA treatment improved electrophysiological conduction parameters, irrespective of the duration of therapy. Improvement mainly concerned nerve conduction velocities, whereas most nerve amplitudes remained unchanged. This means that CDCA treatment did not influence the number of axons activated by maximum electrical stimulation but increased the conduction of the still-excitable fibers.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with asymmetric parkinsonism: a case with I-123-FP-CIT SPECT imaging.
	We report the case of a 44-year-old man who presented with asymmetric parkinsonism. In addition, there were mild bilateral pyramidal signs and a mild polyneuropathy. Brain MRI showed bilateral lesions in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and in the substantia nigra. Nuclear brain imaging using I-123-FP-CIT demonstrated an asymmetric reduced presynaptic dopaminergic function of the putamen and caudate nucleus, correlating well with his lateralized bradykinetic-rigid syndrome. CTX was diagnosed based on an increased plasma level of cholestanol, typical cerebellar brain lesions and the causative genetic mutation. CTX presenting with parkinsonism is considered rare and data on the neuroimaging of the dopaminergic deficit are limited.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare cause of spinocerebellar syndrome.
	A 34-year-old patient demonstrating pyramidal and cerebellar signs, accompanied by epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, mental retardation and bilateral cataract was diagnosed with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis based on the clinical picture, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and serum sterol analysis. Tendon xanthomas were not observed in this case. After establishing the diagnosis, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid and statin was introduced. During the next two years of the follow-up, serum cholestanol and 7Î±-hydroxycholesterol levels decreased in response to the therapy, but this was not reflected in the patient's neurological condition, which was slowly progressing. Treatment effectiveness in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is variable, notably better in patients who had started therapy before the injury to the nervous system took place. The present case report points to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as a rare cause of spinocerebellar syndrome, which might be treatable if diagnosed in early life.

	2 Novel deletions of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in a Chinese Family with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis.
	CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old female with typical CTX clinical manifestation had Spindle-shaped lipid crystal clefts in xanthomas and "onion-like demyelination" in sural nerve. The patient was compound heterozygote carrying two deletions in exon 1 (c.73delG) and exon 2 (c.369_375delGTACCCA). The family memebers were carriers. We investigated the clinic manifestation, histopathology and sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A1) in a Chinese family with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX).

	Three siblings with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis: a novel mutation in the CYP27A1 gene.
	We report three CTX siblings that shared a novel mutation of the CYP27A1 gene. These siblings presented with elevated cholestanol levels and typical manifestations such as tendon xanthomas, cataracts, osteopenia, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. All shared the same genetic mutation, c.1146_1151delins and c.1214G>A of CYP27A1. All were treated with 750 mg/day chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).

	Extreme xanthomatosis in patients with both familial hypercholesterolemia and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Two unrelated individuals were referred to Lipid Clinics in The Netherlands and Chile with extreme xanthomatosis and hypercholesterolemia. Both were diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) after molecular genetic analysis of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Since heFH by itself could not account for the massive xanthomas, the presence of an additional hereditary lipid or lipoprotein disorder was suspected. Further genetic analysis revealed homozygozity for mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene, confirming the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Markedly, the typical neurological manifestations of CTX were absent, suggestive of a protective role of LDL-receptor deficiency against the severe neurological consequences of CTX.

	Monitoring of 7Î±-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one during therapy of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a case report.
	In this study, we report of a 30-year old man with this disorder who was treated using chenodeoxycholic acid, simvastatin, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis. The LDL apheresis was performed weekly for nine months. The first subjective improvement was reported by the patient after his fourth LDL-apheresis. Spasticity, gait disturbances, and his entire psychomotoric test results had improved tremendously. His fine motoric skills have been regained. The efficacy of LDL-apheresis was monitored using quantitative determination of 7Î±-OH-4-cholesten-3-one in plasma based on a LC-MS/MS method. The clearance efficacy of 7Î±-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one from the patient's plasma per LDL-apheresis varied between 8% and 53% but returned to the initial high levels after seven days (mean value 241 ng/mL). A slight negative trend in the plasma concentration could be derived over the period of nine months.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in Spain: clinical, prognostic, and genetic survey.
	RESULTS: Twenty-five patients from 19 families were identified. An average delay of 19 years was observed between symptom onset and clinical diagnosis. Two main clinical subgroups were recognizable: a classic form (cerebellar and other supratentorial symptoms) and a spinal form (chronic myelopathy). Cholestanol levels did not correlate with clinical presentation, severity or response to therapy. Despite treatment, five patients died during follow-up, one to 4 years after diagnosis. Thirteen different mutations were identified, with a higher frequency of p R395C in Northwestern Spain and p R405W in Southern Spain None of the mutations could be associated with a particular clinical feature combination or prognosis.

	Neuromuscular abnormality and autonomic dysfunction in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	METHODS: Four biochemically and genetically confirmed CTX patients, belonging to two families, were included for study and all received nerve conduction study (NCS), muscle biopsy for histopathologic and ultrastructural study, skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber (INEF) density measurement, autonomic testings including sympathetic skin response, R-R interval variation and head-up tilt test using an automated tilt table to record the changes of blood pressure and heart rate in different postures. The Q-Sweat test was also applied for the detection of sweat amount and onset time of response. The clinical characteristics, study methods and results of 13 studies of peripheral neuropathy in CTX patients in the literature were also recorded for analysis. RESULTS: The results of NCS study showed axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy in three CTX cases and mixed axonal and demyelinating sensor-motor polyneuropathy in one. The myopathological and histopathologic studies revealed mild denervation characteristics, but the ultrastructural study revealed changes of mitochondria and the membranous system, and increased amounts of glycogen, lipofuscin and lipid deposition. The ANS study revealed different degrees of abnormalities in the applied tests and the INEF density measurement showed small fiber neuropathy in three of the four CTX patients.

	Neurophysiological study in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	METHODS: We report clinical and neurophysiological results of 13 patients with CTX diagnosed in Spain. RESULTS: In 8 patients (62%), peripheral neuropathy was demonstrated (4 demyelinating, 3 axonal, and 1 mixed; 3 predominantly motor and 5 sensorimotor). All patients had clinical signs/symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Upper limb somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were affected in 38% of patients, and lower limb SSEPs in 67%. Fifty percent of patients had delayed brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and 43% had affected visual evoked potentials.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare genetic disorder.
	A 32-year-old male patient presented with uncontrolled convulsions to the emergency room. He had epilepsy since childhood and was on tablet phenytoin sodium 100 mg three times a day. However, on detailed history elicitation and clinical examination, he was found to have a constellation of findings. He had multiple swellings over both the lower limbs and upper limbs at the site of various tendon insertions (xanthomas), mental retardation, speech disturbance, bilateral pyramidal tract involvement and bilateral cataracts. Based on clinical features, a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a relatively rare genetic disorder was suspected, and later on confirmed histopathologically.

	Clinical relevance and neurophysiological correlates of spasticity in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Twenty-four CTX patients underwent clinical evaluation including general disability scores, pyramidal and cerebellar function scales, assessment of serum cholestanol and TMS. Nine patients who started CDCA therapy at baseline received clinical and neurophysiological follow up. All patients showed signs of pyramidal damage which were relevant for clinical disability in 18 out of 24 cases (75%), resulting in spastic paraparesis. TMS revealed corticospinal alterations even in subjects with mild clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement. After CDCA treatment, serum cholestanol decreased to normal concentrations in all patients. Clinical picture was unchanged in seven out of nine cases; in two others pyramidal signs disappeared. A reduction in abnormal neurophysiological parameters was found. Spastic paraparesis is the most frequent and relevant neurological feature in CTX patients. Replacement treatment with CDCA can prevent the progression of pyramidal damage, especially if started early in the course of the disease. TMS represents a sensitive indicator of corticospinal tract dysfunction and subclinical improvements in pyramidal function after CDCA therapy.

	Clinical imaging and neuropathological correlations in an unusual case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We report a 64-year-old female patient with a progressive gait disorder associated with cognitive decline since the age of 59. The patient had no mental retardation, cataract or chronic diarrhea. Her family reported increasing behavioral modifications 10 years previously. Clinical examination revealed a spastic paraplegia and bilateral xanthomas on the Achilles tendons. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse hyperintense T2 abnormalities in the pyramidal tracts from the internal capsules to the cerebral peduncles also Technetium-99m-ECD brain SPECT showed a severe cerebellar hypoperfusion. Serum cholestanol analysis was 7 Âµmol/l (N). After 2 years, she was bedridden and died of aspiration pneumonia. The neuropathological study confirmed the CTX diagnosis and the sequencing analysis revealed that she was compound heterozygous for two mutations in the CYP27A1 gene: 1435 C > T (exon 7) on one allele and a new mutation, 1017 G > C (exon 5) on the other. The interest of the present case is to report neuropathology findings strongly correlated with the MRI and SPECT abnormalities.

	Clinical relevance of brain volume changes in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	METHODS: 24 CTX patients underwent conventional MRI to measure total and regional brain volumes. In five CTX patients who started therapy at baseline, clinical and MRI examinations were repeated after 2 years. Clinical disability, overall cognitive performance and cerebellar function were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (RS), Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and cerebellar functional system score (CB-FSS).

	A novel mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene of a woman with autosomal recessive cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We diagnosed the clinical features of CTX in a caucasian woman. Serum levels of cholestanol and 7Î±-hydroxycholesterol were elevated and the concentration of 27-hydroxycholesterol was reduced. Bile alcohols in the urine and faeces were increased. The analysis of the CYP27A1 gene showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote carrying two mutations both located in exon 8. One mutation is a novel four nucleotide deletion (c.1330-1333delTTCC) that results in a frameshift and the occurrence of a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated protein of 448 amino acids. The other mutation, previously reported, is a C - > T transition (c. c.1381C > T) that converts the glutamine codon at position 461 into a termination codon (p.Q461X). These truncated proteins are expected to have no biological function being devoid of the cysteine residue at position 476 of the normal enzyme that is crucial for heme binding and enzyme activity.

	Multi-parametric neuroimaging evaluation of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and its correlation with neuropsychological presentations.
	We studied the MRI and 99 mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings of CTX patients and made a correlation with the neuropsychological presentations. RESULTS: Cognitive results showed that aside from moderate mental retardation, the patient group performed worse in all cognitive domains. Despite the extensive GM atrophy pattern, the cerebellum, peri-Sylvian regions and parietal-occipital regions were correlated with SPECT results. WM atrophy located in the peri-dentate and left cerebral peduncle areas corresponded with changes in diffusion measures, while axial and radial diffusivity suggested both demyelinating and axonal changes. Changes in FA and MD were preceded by VBM in the corpus callosum and corona radiata. Cognitive results correlated with FA changes.

	Identification of a novel missense mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in two Japanese patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We analyzed the CYP27A1 gene in two Japanese CTX patients. The CYP27A1 gene was amplified by PCR and screened by PCR-SSCP. The nucleotide sequence was analyzed to confirm mutations. Case 1 was a compound heterozygote for Arg104Gln in exon 2 and Arg441Gln in exon 8. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which the Arg104Gln mutation is identified in CTX patients. Probably case 2 would be a compound heterozygote for Arg441Trp in exon 8 and a mutation that was not identified.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We describe two adolescent Indian siblings with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with cognitive impairment, progressive neurological deterioration, juvenile cataracts and chronic diarrhea. Both patients had bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomata. Rapid progression of disease was an unusual finding in these cases. Magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic signal alterations in cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem and posterior cerebral white matter.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): an association of pulverulent cataracts and pseudo-dominant developmental delay in a family with a splice site mutation in CYP27A1--a case report.
	PURPOSE: A 15-year-old boy with developmental delay presented to the pediatric ophthalmology clinic with bilateral pulverulent cataracts. The family was examined for developmental delay, cataracts and systemic problems. METHODS: The parents were consanguineous and originally from Bangladesh. All the children were born in the UK. The mother and 5 children had developmental delay. Three children had global developmental delay, diarrhea and pulverulent cataracts. Two children had microcephaly, developmental delay, constipation and no cataracts. The mother did not have microcephaly, cataracts or gastrointestinal problems. Linkage analysis via autozygosity testing was performed for detection of loci and candidate genes. The patients with cataracts were segregated with homozygous mutations in the CYP27A1 (G to A substitution at position +1 of intron 6).

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with severe externalized disorder: improvement after one year of treatment with chenodeoxycholic Acid.
	We describe two siblings with an early psychiatric presentation of CTX-associated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, also associated with a mild intellectual disability and major behavioral impairments. In both cases, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid improved externalized symptoms and a partial recovery of cognitive impairments was observed. This suggests that CTX is potentially reversible, demonstrating the need for early diagnosis and treatment of this disorder before irreversible neurological lesions can occur.

	MR spectroscopy detects lipid peaks in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Novel MRS findings from 3 patients, using a short TE, were the presence of lipid peaks at 0.9 and 1.3 ppm in the depth of the cerebellar hemisphere; this might represent an additional marker of disease that is CNS-specific and noninvasive. A decrease in NAA concentration was also detected and attributed to neuroaxonal damage. One patient presented an increase in mIns concentration, pointing to gliosis and astrocytic proliferation.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: report of 4 patients].
	We present 4 patients with a history of neurological disorders since childhood and who were diagnosed with CTX after developing tendon xanthomas. Although diagnostic suspicion depends to a large extent on recognition of tendon xanthomas, these are not an early sign of the disease, which can present with neurological disorders, cataracts, and chronic diarrhea. Early diagnosis of CTX therefore rests on measurement of serum beta-cholestanol levels, even in absence of tendon xanthomas.

	Chronic diarrhea and juvenile cataracts: think cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and treat.
	We present 4 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis within 1 family who were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid for 14 years. Two young sisters started treatment at the preclinical stage before the appearance of major symptoms. Their 2 older uncles, who had already developed the complete phenotypic form of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis when diagnosed, commenced treatment at the same time as the sisters, thus establishing a natural control group. After 14 years of chenodeoxycholic acid therapy, the cholestanol levels of all 4 patients decreased to normal levels (<6 microg/mL). Both sisters remained asymptomatic. Only moderate improvement in symptoms was observed in their uncles. In this long-term study, prompt preclinical administration of chenodeoxycholic acid in early childhood completely prevented the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis phenotype in 2 sisters. Pediatricians should be aware of this diagnostic possibility of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in children presenting with chronic diarrhea and juvenile cataracts. Prevention is particularly significant in light of the availability of early genetic diagnosis and the devastating effects of this illness if not treated.

	Elevated cholesterol precursors other than cholestanol can also be a hallmark for CTX.
	We studied cholesterol and phytosterol profiles in two siblings with CTX during follow-up. While cholesterol concentrations were low in both patients, plasma cholestanol was 6-fold higher compared to control values. In addition, both siblings had a more than 100-fold increase in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) and 8-dehydrocholesterol (8DHC). Lathosterol, lanosterol and sitosterol were increased in both patients while concentrations of desmosterol and campesterol were normal. In addition, plasma lathosterol/cholesterol ratios were significantly elevated. After treatment with chenodeoxycholate, both patients showed a marked decrease in cholestanol, 7DHC, 8DHC, lathosterol, lanosterol and sitosterol. In addition, the lathosterol/cholesterol ratio normalized, indicating that overall cholesterol synthesis was sufficiently suppressed. This study shows that elevated cholesterol precursors, other than cholestanol, can be a hallmark for CTX.

	In a female patient with bilateral swelling of the Achilles tendon who underwent biopsy, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was confirmed by combining disease patterns. She suffered from ataxia, depression, epilepsy, reduced intelligence, bilateral cataracts, gallstones, and atherosclerosis. Concentration of serum cholestanol was 10 times higher than normal. As causal therapy, ursodeoxycholic acid and statin drugs were prescribed to halt progression.

	CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented with gradually increasing bilateral ankle swelling. She had a history of bilateral cataracts and left-sided hemiparesis. She had mental retardation, with a history of delayed milestone development. Her serum cholesterol levels were elevated. Aspiration of both ankle swellings revealed histiocytes and many foreign body giant cells. There were numerous rectangular to rhomboid crystals in the background.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: case report with evidence of oxidative stress.
	Here, we present the case of a 49-year-old woman diagnosed at autopsy with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, on the basis of bilateral Achilles tendon granulomas, and typical foamy histiocytic infiltration of the brain, most severe in the dentate nucleus, and a typical clinical presentation. To investigate the pathological manifestations of this disease further, we performed immunohistochemistry for N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)-lysine, an indicator of oxidative damage, and found strong labeling of cytoplasmic material within histiocytes.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Saudi Arabian family-genotyping and long-term follow-up.
	A Saudi Arabian family is described in which there were 2 siblings with typical features of cerebral xanthomatosis CTX including premature cataracts, xanthomata of the Achilles tendons, neuro-psychiatric disturbances, and atherosclerosis. The 2 patients were homozygous for a point mutation in the mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase gene CYP27A1, OMIM 606530 located in the splice site of intron 6, where G was exchanged for A IVS6+1G>A. Their parents were cousins, 5 siblings were healthy, 2 were heterozygous for the mutation, and one showed the wild-type genotype. The father was heterozygous for the mutation, while the other family members were not tested. The progress of the 2 CTX patients over 14 years is described; firstly when they were receiving treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid; when this medication was not available, and later when it was restored. A hereditary hyperlipidemia was also present in this family. It is suggested that when this occurs with CTX, a more serious illness results that merits more aggressive dual therapy.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 43-year-old woman had since childhood suffered from progressive dementia. Gait ataxia and mild polyneuropathy were noted in the neurological examination. She also had painful xanthomas of the achilles tendons. A bilateral cataract operation had been performed during adolescence.

	Unique patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Evidence for presence of a defect in a gene that is not identical to sterol 27-hydroxylase.
	Here, we characterize an adult female patient with tendon xanthomas and classic biochemical findings of CTX (i.e. high levels of bile alcohols and cholestanol and extremely low levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in plasma). Additionally, sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in cultured monocyte-derived macrophages from this patient was <5% of normal. Sequencing the CYP27A1 gene uncovered that the patient is heterozygous for two previously undescribed base substitutions in exon 8, C478A and C479A, which are expected to affect the haeme-binding domain of the enzyme. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the corresponding protein had only 8% of normal enzymatic activity. No other mutation was found in the open reading frame of the CYP27A1 gene, intron-exon boundaries or in the 5'-untranslated region up to 5000 bp distal to the translational start site.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: need for early diagnosis.
	We are reporting a woman with this rare disorder, who was on antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs for a prolonged period and whose original condition went undiagnosed. She presented with xanthomas on the Achilles tendons and the upper end of tibia. She was mentally subnormal and her serum cholestanol level was raised. Her younger sister too was severely affected by this disorder. Early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid is known to prevent disease progression.

	Cholestanol metabolism in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: absorption, turnover, and tissue deposition.
	To study the metabolism of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), we measured the cholestanol absorption, the cholesterol and cholestanol turnover, and the tissue content of sterols in two patients. Cholestanol absorption was approximately 5.0%. The rapid exchangeable pool of cholestanol was 233 mg, and the total exchangeable pool was 752 mg. The production rate of cholestanol in pool A was 39 mg/day. [4-14C]cholestanol was detected in the xanthomas, but neither [4-14C]cholestanol nor [4-14C]cholesterol was detected in peripheral nerves biopsied at 49 and 97 days after [4-14C]cholesterol given intravenously. Of the 18 tissues analyzed at biopsy and autopsy, the cholestanol content varied from 0.09 mg/g in psoas muscle to 76 mg/g in a cerebellar xanthoma. With the assumption that the cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio is 1.0, the relative cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio varied from 1.0 in plasma and liver to 30.0 in the cerebellar xanthoma; cholestanol was especially high in nerve tissue.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomata.
	We report on a case of a 36-year-old lady who presented with large, painful soft-tissue swellings of both Achilles tendons. MRI demonstrated fusiform enlargement involving the Achilles tendons bilaterally. The tendons returned heterogeneous signal intensity characterised by a diffuse reticulated appearance. The right tendon mass was treated with a wide marginal excision and Achilles tendon reconstruction. The histology confirmed Achilles tendon xanthoma. Further metabolic investigation revealed the patient to have a rare autosomal recessive condition called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Her brother was also affected. CTX is easily treatable if diagnosed early, and should be suspected in patients presenting with bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomas and normal plasma lipid levels.

	Could steroids mask the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis?
	In the present report we describe a young man with CTX who was on high dose steroids for a misdiagnosed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and had normal level of serum cholestanol. When steroids were discontinued, markedly elevated serum cholestanol was measured concomitant with marked clinical worsening. This observation may imply that steroids can lower plasma cholestanol, possibly by directly inducing residual CYP27A1 activity or by inducing alternative pathways for cholestanol elimination.

	Inherited cholesterol lipidosis: cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (van Bogaert Scherer Epstein disease). A clinicopathological study.
	We present a case of CTX with clinical progression as well as the pathomorphologic autopsy findings. The CNS affection in our case will be demonstrated and the pathogenesis be discussed. Medical treatment of CTX is possible but with variable success. In the case shown, the patient profited only marginally from a long-term application of chenodeoxycholic acid.

	Unusual cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with fronto-temporal dementia phenotype.
	We report a 53-year-old man, with an unusual phenotype of CTX. He had xanthomas since adolescence. He had no mental retardation and developed at 44 years a progressive neuropsychiatric phenotype, suggestive of fronto-temporal dementia according to clinical Neary criteria. Cataract and ataxia were absent. Cerebral MRI revealed diffuse hyperintense T2 abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter without cerebellar atrophy or lesions, while Technetium-99m-ECD brain SPECT revealed a severe cerebellar hypoperfusion. Serum cholestanol level was elevated with excessive urinary bile alcohols excretion. Mutation analysis revealed that he was compound heterozygous for two mutations in the CYP27A1 gene: 1016 C > T (exon 5) on one allele and a novel mutation, 1435C > G (exon 8) on the other allele. A follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and simvastatin treatment during 3 years. In spite of this treatment, cognitive functions declined but no other signs of neurological deterioration appeared.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: possible higher prevalence than previously recognized.
	SETTING: University hospital. RESULTS: The proband and her affected sibling had classic features of CTX, including presenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, diarrhea, and a complex neurodegenerative disorder. They were somewhat atypical, however, because their cataracts were congenital, cognitive impairment had been noted in childhood, and the white matter involvement was more severe than usual. The proband was shown to be homozygous for CYP27 mutation R362C.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: report of two Brazilian brothers.
	We describe two Brazilian brothers with cognitive impairement and chronic diarrhea. One of them also presents bilateral cataracts. Neurological findings were progressive walking deficit, limb ataxia and pyramidal signs. Both patients had bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomata. Magnetic resonance image showed signal alterations in cerebellar hemispheres. We describe these cases with molecular genetic analysis confirming diagnosis and comparing with previous literature. The CYP27A1 gene study showed a C1187T mutation on exon 6.

	Coronary heart disease in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Here, we present the clinical, analytical and molecular features of a 36-years-old man who died from advanced ischaemic heart disease as a result of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare condition characterized by elevation in plasma and most tissues of cholestanol and where neurological impairment is the hallmark of this disease. We discuss the relevance of heart disease and the mechanism leading to accelerate arteriosclerosis is CTX.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Hong Kong Chinese kinship with a novel splicing site mutation IVS6-1G>T in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene.
	We reported a Hong Kong Chinese proband with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis in which a novel acceptor splicing site mutation (IVS6-1G>T) was identified. Family screening revealed the same mutation in his elder brother and the youngest sister. All the three affected siblings were compound heterozygous for IVS6-1G>T and a known missense mutation R372Q (GenBank Accession No. M62401). Significant phenotypic variation was noted among them that the youngest sister was still symptom-free at the time of writing.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: neuroimaging findings in two siblings from an Indian family.
	We present and discuss the clinical, radiological and histopathologic findings in 2 siblings with CTX. Both the patients had juvenile cataract, mental retardation and marked cerebellar ataxia. The Achilles tendon swelling was present in only 1 patient (Case 2). MR imaging showed typical bilateral and symmetrical involvement of the dentate nuclei, inferior olives, brainstem and cerebellar hemispheric white matter. Although the diagnosis of CTX was made in the 3rd decade in both our cases, early diagnosis is possible if neuroimaging is done in the early course of the disease.

	Combined treatment with LDL-apheresis, chenodeoxycholic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The effects of combined treatment with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor were studied in 2 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Patient 1 was initially treated with LDL-apheresis alone: serum cholestanol levels decreased by 50% after each apheresis, but returned to their initial levels within 2 weeks. After an addition of CDCA administration, the serum cholestanol levels steadily decreased, resulting in slight improvement of neurological symptoms. Patient 2 received a combined treatment with LDL-apheresis, CDCA and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This combination showed less LDL-apheresis-dependent fluctuation and more rapid decrease of serum cholestanol levels than those in Patient 1, resulting in improvement and stabilization of the symptoms.

	An autopsy case of gallbladder cancer developing in a Japanese man with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: genetic analysis of the sterol 27-hydroxylase and p53 genes.
	A case of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder occurring in a 57-year-old Japanese man with CTX, confirmed clinically, biochemically and at autopsy is reported together with analyses of the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) and p53 genes. A missense mutation of the p53 (G for C) was detected in the gallbladder adenocarcinoma. Direct sequence analysis also showed a silent mutational substitution of unknown significance, C for A, in CYP27 at codon 89. In the past, CTX patients have only demonstrated this infrequently, indicating no direct relationship between CYP27 dysfunction and tumour development. Thus, the present case of gallbladder cancer appears to be a chance occurrence.

	Mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A) cause hepatitis of infancy as well as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Follow-up investigations were undertaken on a previously reported patient who had severe familial giant cell hepatitis in infancy associated with substantially increased urinary excretion of bile alcohol glucuronides. By the age of 11 years, he had developed a profile of cholanoids in plasma and urine that closely resembled the pattern seen in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Sequencing of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A) showed that he was homozygous for a deletion (525/526delG) that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. This genotype has previously been described in an adult female with classical symptoms of CTX (tendon xanthomata, cataracts and deteriorating cognitive function). A review of past medical histories of a group of patients with CTX revealed that prolonged neonatal cholestatic jaundice was common. The family histories also revealed fetal and neonatal deaths among siblings of patients with CTX.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendinous xanthomas: presentation of two cases].
	We report two siblings with a history of photosensitive epilepsy of childhood onset, who developed progressive spastic paraparesis and cataracts in their third decade of life. They were diagnosed to have CTX in spite of the absence of tendinous xanthomas. Cranial and spinal MRI only showed bilateral high intensity signal in the dentate nuclei in the T2-weighted and proton-density sequences. Our patients presented with a progressive spastic paraparesis. The delay in the diagnosis in our case could be due to the absence of tendinous xanthomas and late-onset cataracts. The recognition of the disease is important, because the treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid induces a decrement of beta-cholestanol levels in serum and could prevent the progression of the disease.

12486565
	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a treatable metabolic disorder].
	Here,we describe two women who were diagnosed with CTX during their forties after symptoms had already developed 15 years earlier Both patients showed gait ataxia, spastic paraparesis, polyneuropathy, bilateral premature cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and cognitive deficits. One of the patients had also chronic diarrhea. The deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase results in a virtual absence of chenodeoxycholic acid. This leads to excessive production of cholestanol and cholesterol and accumulation of these sterols in many tissues, especially the eye lens, central nervous system,and tendons. The determination of a high cholestanol serum level allows the diagnosis,which can be confirmed through genetic analysis. Early diagnosis of CTX is important, since an effective therapy is available. Long-term therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid is effective for CTX, mainly in prevention of further deterioration.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: molecular characterization of two Scandinavian sisters.
	The only CTX patients diagnosed in Scandinavia are two Norwegian sisters from a consanguineous marriage. Here we have characterized the mutation and its functional consequences for the enzyme. Analysis of genomic DNA from cultured fibroblasts identified a base exchange C > T in position 1441, causing arginine at amino acid position 441 to be replaced by tryptophan. The same mutation was introduced by mutagenesis in the complimentary DNA (cDNA) for CYP27, ligated into the expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax and transfected into HEK293 cells. The mutated enzyme had less than 5% of the enzyme activity compared with the native enzyme. No abnormal catalytic products could be identified in the cell culture medium. Probably the mutation affects the haem binding within the holoenzyme. The mutation has also previously been reported in a Japanese family. This is the second example of a CTX-causing mutation that has been recognized in more than one population.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with psychiatric disorders: report of three siblings and literature review.
	We present three siblings in one family with CTX combined with moderate mental retardation. One of the siblings had long-term depressed mood, irritability, poor appetite, insomnia, fatigability, and pessimistic thinking and was diagnosed as dysthymic disorder. After 2.5 years of antidepressant treatment at our outpatient clinic, the depressive symptoms of the dysthymic sibling improved greatly. However, the results of the IQ tests of the three siblings did not change after effective treatments for physical manifestations of CTX. In addition, the authors reviewed the literature of CTX combined with psychiatric disorders.

	Two novel mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene causing cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The present authors describe a female patient with CTX. The proband in this study presented with elevated cholestanol levels, markedly reduced mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase activity and altered bile acid composition. The 27-hydroxylase gene was analysed for mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the exons and the splice-junction regions of the gene. The proband was found to be a compound heterozygote for two different mutations which have not been previously described: (1) a G --> A transition at nucleotide 455 that is responsible for converting a glycine to a glutamic acid residue at amino acid position 112 (G112E); and (2) a five-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 (from nucleotide 965 to 969) that is responsible for a shift in the reading frame and the insertion of a premature codon at position 296, and consequently, the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the heme-binding and andrenodoxin-binding domains. Long-term (18-year) treatment of the proband with chenodeoxycholic acid (750 mg day-1) has been effective in preventing any progression of the disease.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare disease with diverse manifestations.
	This mini-review deals with a new appraisal of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In addition to neurologic symptoms, patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis develop cataracts, diarrhea, Achilles tendon xanthoma, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and many other abnormalities. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is not completely understood, excess production and consequent accumulation of cholestanol in tissues may play a crucial role. Chenodeoxycholic acid is the most effective therapy. The causative role and detrimental effects (at a low plasma level) of cholestanol merit further investigation.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: heterogeneity of clinical phenotype with evidence of previously undescribed ophthalmological findings.
	To gain more insight into the type and frequency of ophthalmological alterations in this multisystem metabolic disorder, we examined 13 CTX patients. Besides cataracts, found in all cases, the second most frequent ocular abnormality was paleness of the optic disk, which was found in 6 patients and was probably previously underestimated. Signs of premature retinal senescence were also observed. We discuss the possible relation between these ocular manifestations and the metabolic defect.

	Structure-function analysis of CYP27B1 and CYP27A1. Studies on mutants from patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type I (VDDR-I) and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
	We have determined eight types of missense mutants of CYP27B1 from Japanese vitamin D-dependent rickets type I (VDDR-I) patients [Kitanaka, S., Takeyama, K., Murayama, A., Sato, T., Okumura, K., Nogami, M., Hasegawa, Y., Niimi, H., Yanagisawa, J., Tanaka, T. & Kato, S. (1998) New England J. Med., 338, 653-661 and Kitanaka, S., Murayama, A., Sakaki, T., Inouye, K., Seino, Y., Fukumoto, S., Shima, M., Yukizane, S., Takayanagi, M., Niimi, H., Takeyama, K. & Kato, S. (1999) J. Clin. Endocrine Metab., 84, 4111-4117]. None of the CYP27B1 mutants showed 1alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Thus, it was assumed that the mutated amino-acid residues play important roles in the 1alpha-hydroxylase activity, such as substrate binding, activation of molecular oxygen, interaction with adrenodoxin, and folding of the cytochrome P450 structure. To examine our hypothesis, we generated various mutants of CYP27B1 and studied their enzymatic properties. In addition, the corresponding mutations were introduced to CYP27A1, which belongs to the same family as CYP27B1. As CYP27A1 showed much higher expression level than CYP27B1 in Escherichia coli, further analysis including heme-binding and substrate-binding was performed with CYP27A1 in place of CYP27B1. Western blot analysis, spectral analysis including reduced CO-difference spectra and substrate-induced difference spectra, and enzymatic analysis of the mutant CYP27A1 gave information on the structure-function relationships of both CYP27A1 and CYP27B1. Although the sequence alignment suggested that Arg107, Gly125, and Pro497 of CYP27B1 might be involved in substrate binding, the experimental data strongly suggested that mutations of these amino-acid residues destroyed the tertiary structure of the substrate-heme pocket. It was also suggested that Arg389 and Arg453 of CYP27B1 were involved in heme-propionate binding, and Asp164 stabilized the four-helix bundle consisting of D, E, I and J helices, possibly by forming a salt bridge. Thr321 was found to be responsible for the activation of molecular oxygen.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: 11-year treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid in five patients. An electrophysiological study.
	We report the electrophysiological follow-up of five cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients treated for 11 years with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was reduced in three cases. P100 latency of visual evoked potentials was delayed in four cases, interpeaks I-III and I-V of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) was increased in two and interpeak N13-20 of upper limb somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) was slowed in one. After 4 months of therapy with CDCA, NCV was normal and did not show any significant change during the 11 years of observation. Central motor conduction time of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and N24-P40 interpeak latency of lower limb SEPs were increased in five and four cases, respectively, in spite of 2/3-year treatment with CDCA. Improvement of evoked potentials, especially of MEPs and SEPs, was slower and continued over the whole 11-year period. The size of xanthomas slightly decreased in some patients during treatment and the clinical manifestations stabilized, avoiding progressive worsening, but there was no significant improvement in neurological deficit. Two sisters of patients who never took CDCA showed progressive worsening of clinical manifestations, upper limb SEPs and BAEPs.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	A 24-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy had suffered from diarrhoea, walking disorders, visual complaints and other complaints for many years. Once the suspicion of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) had been confirmed with biochemical and genetic tests and treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid had been started, the diarrhoea disappeared and the neurological symptoms lessened. CTX is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disease. The clinical hallmarks are: bilateral juvenile cataract, chronic diarrhoea, progressive neurological symptoms and signs, and tendon xanthomas. The phenotypic variability often hinders the clinical diagnosis. The biochemical diagnosis can be made by determining the serum cholestanol level and the excretion of urinary bile alcohols, followed by a mutation analysis. CTX is a treatable disease and therefore an early diagnosis is important.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	A 55-year-old woman presented with a slowly progressive paraparesia and two firm subcutaneous tumors over the knees. Her medical history revealed difficulty in standing and walking since infancy, bilateral juvenile cataracts, and mental retardation. Histopathologic examination of one subcutaneous tumor was consistent with tendinous xanthoma. Substantial elevation of urinary bile alcohols confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment with oral chenodeoxycholic acid was started, with only mild improvement of spasticity. Recognition of tendon xanthomas in a young patient with neurologic symptoms or cataracts (or both) is crucial to start early treatment and to avoid irreversible neurologic sequelae.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in three siblings from a Chinese family.
	We reported a 31-year-old Chinese male in Hong Kong, who has the characteristic features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis including the multiple xanthomas of tendons, mental retardation, bilateral cataracts, cerebellar ataxia and spasticity of the left arm, high concentrations of plasma phytosterols and abnormal MR of brain. On screening the family, two other siblings of 27 and 29 respectively, have tendon xanthomas and high plasma phytosterols. An extensive search of the international medical literature, including the Medline, has revealed only one other case report of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in Taiwan. CTX is a potentially treatable disease. It is hoped by alertness, early diagnosis and treatment can be made, and hence prevent further progression of the disease.

	Clinical and biochemical features, molecular diagnosis and long-term management of a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We describe the clinical and biochemical features, molecular diagnosis and long-term management of the first reported Australasian case of CTX. Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of CTX and demonstrated that the patient was homozygous for a G-->A transition in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene. Serum cholestanol concentrations were decreased with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin alone and greater reductions were achieved after the addition of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid; suggesting a synergistic effect of this combination. Despite serum cholestanol concentrations remaining within the low-normal range, there has been no significant improvement in mental and physical abilities or in EEG abnormalities with 5 years of treatment. Metabolism of radiolabeled 7-ketocholesterol to aqueous soluble products was absent in CTX-derived macrophages.

	Diphenylpyraline-responsive parkinsonism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: long-term follow up of three patients.
	A long-term follow-up study was made of three patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) associated with parkinsonism, two of whom were siblings. Besides typical CTX symptoms, all three patients showed severe parkinsonism. This observation has been rarely reported in CTX. The fact that the two siblings showed parkinsonism strongly suggests the genetic propensity to parkinsonism in these CTX patients. Positron emission tomography studies of the two patients revealed presynaptic dysfunction of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system. Treatment with the reductase inhibitor hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme successfully corrected the serum cholestanol level in the early stage of the disease, which, however, did not arrest the progression of clinical symptoms, particularly their parkinsonism. Clinically, levodopa had a little effect on parkinsonism, whereas an antihistamine drug, diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (DPP) had excellent effects on all three patients throughout the long-term follow up. The mechanism of the action of DPP on parkinsonism is unclear, however, the drug seems to be a therapeutic choice for treating parkinsonism in CTX.

	Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic changes in brains of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	To clarify both neuroradiological and pathological issues, we performed combined brain MRI and spectroscopy examinations on 12 CTX patients. On conventional MRIs, bilateral hyperintensities of the dentate nuclei were clearly seen in nine out of 12 patients on T(2) -weighted MRIs, but were evident in all patients using a FLAIR sequence. On proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, significant decreases in N: -acetylaspartate resonance intensities (P: <0.0001) and increases in lactate MR signals (P<0.05) were found in the group of CTX patients in large volumes of interest localized above the lateral brain ventricles and in the cerebellar hemispheres. Cerebral values of N -acetylaspartate resonance intensities showed a close correlation with patients' disability (Spearman rank correlation = -0.78, P<0.005).

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: the spectrum of imaging findings and the correlation with neuropathologic findings.
	PURPOSE: To describe imaging findings and their neuropathologic correlate in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images in 24 patients with symptoms (mean age at time of imaging, 37 years; mean disease duration, 18 years) were reviewed for site and frequency of brain, spinal cord, and Achilles tendon involvement. Two patients died, and imaging findings were compared with postmortem neuropathologic findings.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Controversies about nerve and muscle: observations in ten patients.
	Neuromuscular characteristics were documented in ten patients with biochemically and genetically confirmed cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. An array of genotypes was found in these patients. Only one patient complained of muscle weakness, while clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy were present in six patients. Electromyogram showed predominantly axonal neuropathy in seven patients. Neurogenic changes were seen in muscle biopsies of nine patients. Sural nerve biopsies of three patients showed features of axonal neuropathy. In addition, in one patient, extensive onion bulb formation was seen, which is indicative of a primarily demyelinating process. Five patients had normal mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity. It is concluded that myopathy is not a feature of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and that the most prominent neuromuscular abnormality is sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy.

	[A case of familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia with the clinical features similar to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	A 63-years-old woman noticed unsteady gait at the age of 56 years and then developed dysarthria two years later. A general physical examination at age 56 revealed mild hypertrophy of both Achilles tendons. On neurological examination, she had scanning speech, moderate limb and truncal ataxia, and moderate hyperreflexia of all limbs. A soft tissue X-ray examination disclosed hypertrophy of both Achilles tendons with multiple punctate calcification. Brain MRI showed diffuse cerebellar atrophy. Motor evoked potentials in the right limb disclosed a prolonged central conduction time. Blood chemistry showed familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia (cholesterol 320 mg/dl, and LDL-cholesterol 245 mg/dl), yet cholestanol level was normal. A examination of CTX gene mutation at hot spots revealed no mutation. Her mother and two siblings also had hypertrophy of Achilles tendons as well as type IIa hypercholesterolemia. In addition, the one sibling showed mild ataxia of lower limbs, respectively. This report suggests a possible link between familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia and cerebellar degeneration syndrome clinically mimicking CTX.

	The clinical, biochemical and magnetic resonance imaging findings of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are reported. This is a rare hereditary disease. Early recognition of this entity is important in view of the existing treatment possibilities. Magnetic resonance imaging findings typically include a bilateral and almost symmetrical increase of the signal intensity on the T2-weighted images in the cerebellar and periventricular cerebral white matter, the basal ganglia, the dentate nuclei and the brainstem as well as cerebellar and cerebral atrophy.

	Clinical and molecular genetic characteristics of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In this study we report on mutations in 58 patients with CTX out of 32 unrelated families. Eight of these were novel mutations, two of which were found together with two already known pathogenic mutations. Twelve mutations found in this patient group have been described in the literature. In the patients from 31 families, mutations were found in both alleles. In the literature, 28 mutations in 67 patients with CTX out of 44 families have been described. Pooling our patient group and the patients from the literature together, 37 different mutations in 125 patients out of 74 families were obtained. Identical mutations have been found in families from different ethnic backgrounds. In 41% of all the patients, CYP 27 gene mutations are found in the region of exons 6-8. This region encodes for adrenodoxin and haem binding sites of the protein. Of these 125 patients, a genotype-phenotype analysis was done for 79 homozygous patients harbouring 23 different mutations, out of 45 families. The patients with compound heterozygous mutations were left out of the genotype-phenotype analysis. The genotype-phenotype analysis did not reveal any correlation.

	Presence of diarrhea and absence of tendon xanthomas in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	OBJECTIVES: To investigate signs and symptoms, age at onset, and age at diagnosis in 32 patients with biochemically and genetically confirmed CTX, and to compare this clinical spectrum with reports in the literature. A diagnosis of CTX should be considered in patients with premature bilateral cataracts, intractable diarrhea, neurological signs and symptoms, and tendon xanthomas, especially in the Achilles tendons. The prevalence of these signs and symptoms increases with age. RESULTS: Of our 32 patients with CTX, 31 (97%) had cataracts and neurological signs and symptoms, predominantly pyramidal signs (26 [81%]); 21 (66%) had low intelligence and 18 (56%) had cerebellar signs. Only 13 (41%) had visible or palpable tendon xanthomas at the time of diagnosis. In total, 16 patients (50%) had chronic, intractable diarrhea that started in childhood. These findings were in contrast with the literature, where tendon xanthomas were reported in 89% and diarrhea in only 2 patients.

	Sudden death due to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis confirmed by mutation analysis.
	A case of sudden death of a 52-year-old mentally retarded Caucasian male is described where the rectal temperature was 43.4 degrees C 3 h postmortem. The autopsy revealed cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare hereditary metabolic disorder, as the primary disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem identification of two mutations (compound heterozygosity for R237X and IVS6+1G-->A) in the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene. Both mutations have already been described in patients with CTX and can be considered the most likely cause of the disease. The pathomechanism of the excessive hyperthermia could not be completely elucidated.

	Mutation of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) results in truncation of mRNA expressed in leucocytes in a Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	OBJECTIVES: A Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts, prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique.

	Spinal xanthomatosis: a variant of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We describe seven Dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive, mainly spinal cord syndrome that remained for many years the sole expression of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Post-mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns. An array of genotypes was found in these patients.

	Mutations producing premature termination of translation and an amino acid substitution in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis associated with parkinsonism.
	OBJECTIVES: Mutational analysis of the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene was performed on three patients from two Japanese families who had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) associated with parkinsonism. METHODS: Clinical evaluations, brain MRI studies, and laboratory analyses were completed on the three patients. The CYP27 gene was analysed for mutations by PCR amplification of gene segments followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Two different, homozygous mutations were identified in these families. One is a novel transition, substituting T for G at Glu162 (GAG) resulting in a stop codon (TAG). The other is also a transition, substituting T for C at Arg441 (CGG) resulting in Trp (TGG). The second is located in two amino acids ahead of the heme ligand binding site (Cys443) of the protein likely rendering it non-functional. It is the most common CTX mutation in Japanese patients.

	Effect of simvastatin in addition to chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The effects of combination therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and simvastatin on serum cholestanol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and lathosterol levels were investigated in seven adult patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) who were on long-term treatment with CDCA. The patients were treated with a combination of CDCA 750 mg daily and an increasing dose of simvastatin from 10 mg to 40 mg daily for a period of 6 months. We found a significant effect of this combination therapy compared with CDCA alone in terms of decreasing the serum cholestanol and LDL cholesterol levels, particularly with a daily dose of 40 mg simvastatin. The mean cholestanol level decreased from 9.27 micromol/L (baseline) to 6.69 micromol/L (40 mg simvastatin), while the mean LDL cholesterol level decreased from 5.08 mmol/L (baseline) to 3.04 mmol/L (40 mg simvastatin). No side effects were reported, and there were no effects on the clinical condition, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual evoked potentials, and electroencephalographic features.

	Pulmonary manifestations in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We investigated five cases with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) with particular reference to biochemical and pathological pulmonary disorders. To date, few reports discuss the pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders of CTX patients. This study is the first investigation of such pulmonary disorders. All 5 patients had no pulmonary symptoms and no disturbances on radiological studies and pulmonary function tests. However, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, many cells with cruciform reflexes, which is characteristic of intracellular sterol accumulation, were found under phase contrast microscopy. Biochemically, cholestanol was found to be increased in the BAL fluid as well as in serum. Pathological findings of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) samples disclosed foamy macrophages and small granulomas in alveolar septa.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: evidence of lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum.
	We examined nine CTX patients to determine whether they also had clinical or subclinical signs of cardiovascular disorders. In four of them, transthoracic echocardiography showed thickening of the interatrial septum compatible with lipomatous hypertrophy. The unexpected association of the two abnormalities is unlikely to be coincidental and suggests that careful cardiac examination should be considered, even in the absence of clinical manifestations.

	Genetic analysis enables definite and rapid diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We report the identification of three types of mutations (Arg441Trp, Arg372Gln, and Arg441Gln) in the CYP27 gene in five patients with suspected CTX from four unrelated families by restriction endonuclease analysis.

	Treatment and follow-up of children with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The clinical spectrum and the effects of treatment over a period of 5 years in five children with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) are described. In all children biochemical, neuroradiological, and neurophysiological studies were done. CTX was diagnosed and effects of therapy were evaluated by determination of the serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (CCR) and the urinary excretion of bile alcohols. All children were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg/day) in three divided oral doses. Diarrhoea and juvenile cataract were the main clinical features. Psychomotor retardation, pyramidal and cerebellar signs were also found. After starting treatment, biochemical abnormalities normalized and diarrhoea disappeared. After 1 year of therapy there was no further delay in motor development, and in three children the intelligence quotient improved. EEG abnormalities disappeared. After 5 years of therapy the children are in a stable clinical condition.

	Silent nucleotide substitution in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) leads to alternative pre-mRNA splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site at the mutant codon in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients.
	A functionally silent nucleotide substitution of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27), identified in two families with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), was confirmed to cause alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. Full-length RT-PCR analysis of the CYP 27 gene in a patient from one of the CTX families revealed one major and an additional faint band. Sequence analysis of the cloned RT-PCR product showed three species of cDNA: 3' terminal 13 bp of exon 2 deleted cDNA, exon 2 skipped cDNA, and full-length cDNA with a functionally silent G to T mutation at codon 112 (GGG 112Gly to GGT 112Gly). Only a single base change was identified by genomic DNA sequence analysis of the CYP 27 gene in the patient: T replaced G at the third position of codon 112, 13 bp upstream from the 3' terminus of exon 2. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, confirmed that this silent mutation resulted in alternative pre-mRNA splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site around the mutant codon. The mutation was also identified in two patients from another CTX family, with a compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at codon 372, a mutation reported previously by our group.

	Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) caused by a G to A mutation at the last nucleotide of exon 6 in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
	A recently identified G to A mutation at the last nucleotide of exon 6 of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was shown here to cause alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. Northern blot analysis of the patient's RNA revealed a broadened band in the human CYP 27 mRNA region compared to that of the normal sample, indicating that there may exist differently spliced mRNA species in the patient. RT-PCR produced three fragments in the patient, one was full-length size and the other two were of smaller sizes. Sequence analysis confirmed that the nucleotide of the full-length size was identical to that of the normal full-length cDNA, except for the G to A mutation at codon 362, which corresponds to the last nucleotide of exon 6. One of the smaller size species lacked exon 6 and the other was absent from the 3' terminal 88 bp of exon 6 due to the use of an activated cryptic 5' splice site in exon 6. The correctly spliced mRNA harbouring the G to A mutation was responsible for the deficiency of the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by transfection experiment. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, showed that correctly spliced mRNA was observed in the normal minigene while the mutant minigene was differently spliced. This is the first report of a G to A substitution at the last nucleotide of an exon resulting in both normal and abnormal pre-mRNA splicings, including exon skipping and activating of a coding region cryptic 5' splice site.

	Four novel mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in Italian patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We report the characterization of eight mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) in five Italian patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, who were found to be compound heterozygotes. Four mutations (C --> T at nt 45 of exon 4, G(+1) --> A in intron 6, G(+5) --> T in intron 7, and G(-1) --> A in intron 7) are novel. The C --> T at nt 45 of exon 4 converts the arginine codon into a stop codon thus generating a truncated protein of 198 amino acids. The three splice site mutations reduced the content of CYP27 mRNA in skin fibroblasts to very low or undetectable levels and generated minute amounts of abnormal mRNAs. The G(+1) --> A transition in intron 6 produced three abnormal mRNAs. In the first, the 5' half of exon 6 joins to exon 7, skipping 89 bp of exon 6, and in the second, exon 5 joins directly to exon 7. The predicted translation products of these mRNAs are truncated proteins. In the third abnormal mRNA, exon 5 joins to exon 8 with an in-frame deletion of 246 bp. The G(+5) --> T transversion in intron 7 generates a single abnormal mRNA in which exon 6 joins directly to exon 8, with a frameshift and a premature stop codon. In the G(-1) --> A transition in intron 7, two mRNAs are generated. In the first, the retention of the whole intron 7 causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon; in the second, the joining of exon 7 to exon 8 is associated with an in-frame deletion of the first 6 nucleotides. All these novel mutations are predicted to produce structurally abnormal enzymatic proteins with no measurable biological activity.

	Exon skipping in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene leads to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We report a new mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP 27) gene in a Dutch family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a G-->A transition in the splice donor site in intron 4. This mutation leads to skipping of exon 4, resulting in a loss of 66 amino acids in the CYP 27 enzyme molecule.

	Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: is there a link?
	A 41-year-old woman had progressive shortness of breath. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was diagnosed 4 years before. An open-lung biopsy showed the simultaneous presence of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. This is perhaps the first time the coincidental occurrence of these two diseases is described.

	Novel homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in three Japanese patients from two unrelated families.
	Three Japanese CTX patients from two unrelated families were studied genetically. By DNA sequence analysis a novel mutation of A for G substitution at amino acid position 372 (CGG 372Arg to CAG 372Gln) was identified in one of the CTX families. The mutation was also found in two patients from the other family, with a compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at amino acid position 441 (CGG 441Arg to CAG 441Gln). The latter mutation was the same as previously reported by our group (J. Lipid Res. 1994. 35: 1031-1039). As the two mutations changed the restriction enzyme sites, rapid screening methods were developed for the detection of the carriers. Transfection of the two mutant cDNAs into COS cells resulted in markedly reduced sterol 27-hydroxylase activity.

	Failure in the treatment of long-standing osteoporosis in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We evaluated the therapeutic effect of combined therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid, calcium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate on long-standing osteoporsis in three siblings (two women and one man, aged 30-38 yr) with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The evaluation was based on the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) before and after 3 years of combined therapy. Clinically, the therapeutic effect was quite limited (almost no change in BMD values), and did not parallel the marked decrease in serum cholestanol level (normalization of serum levels). While the reason for the therapeutic failure in our patients is not known, it is possible that delay in starting treatment may have been a factor. Measurement of BMD for evaluation of therapeutic effect in long-standing osteoporosis in CTX patients is of little practical value.

	A novel mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene of a Pakistani family with autosomal recessive cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We analyzed a Pakistani family, which included four affected individuals with clinical characteristics of CTX, for mutations in CYP27. The exons of CYP27 in the family DNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed for mutations by band shifts (single stranded conformational polymorphism [SSCP]) and DNA sequencing. The PCR product for exon 4 showed an SSCP change in this family. The DNA of affected individuals showed an abnormal mobility pattern interpreted as homozygous for the mutation. One non-affected sibling was homozygous for the normal migrating pattern, whereas the parents and another non-affected sibling were heterozygous. The sequence of exon 4 of affected individuals showed a substitution of C to T in codon 237, thus substituting arginine to a stop codon. This mutation would terminate the translation, which may result in a protein half the size of the wild type rendering it practically inactive.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: utility of nuclear magnetic resonance image in the follow-up and response to treatment].
	CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a 34-year-old male suffering from ataxia and enlargement of both Achilles tendons suggestive of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The findings of elevated serum cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols confirmed clinical suspicious. Cranial and tendinous MRI evidenced cerebral, cerebellar, medullar and tendinous lesions. The patient received treatment with CDCA for 42 months (750 mg/day), with improvement in neurologic symptoms, correction of analytical parameters and cerebellar and medullar lesions at MRI.

	Two new mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in two families lead to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	This report concerns two new mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). In a Surinam-Creole patient (patient A), a G deletion on position cDNA 546/547 in exon 3 led to a frameshift and the introduction of a premature termination codon. In a Dutch patient (patient B), a C-->T transition at position 496 in exon 3 also led to a premature termination codon. Patient A was homozygous for the mutation, whereas patient B was compound heterozygous, a C-->T transition also being found in exon 6 at position 1204. The two new mutations were confirmed by restriction analysis with the restriction enzymes FokI and MaeI, respectively.

	Genetic analysis of a Japanese cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis family: identification of a novel mutation in the adrenodoxin binding region of the CYP 27 gene.
	A 24-year-old female Japanese CTX patient and her parents were studied for a CYP 27 mutation. Multiple xanthomas were the main complaint of the patient and plasma cholestanol level was markedly elevated. Sterol analysis of a xanthoma biopsy confirmed cholesterol and cholestanol deposition, and the cholestanol accounted for 8.1% of the total sterols. Sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in fibroblasts derived from the patient was undetectable, while the activities in fibroblasts from her mother and father were 54% and 41% of the normal level, respectively. Direct sequence analysis showed a missense mutation of A for G substitution in the CYP 27 gene at codon 362 (CGT 362Arg to CAT 362His) with a homozygous pattern in the patient, and a heterozygous pattern in the parents. The mutation, which eliminates a normal HgaI endonuclease site at position 1195 of the cDNA and is located at the adrenodoxin binding region of the gene, is most probably responsible for the decreased sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in this Japanese CTX family. The combined data strongly support that the primary enzymatic defect in CTX is the disruption of sterol 27-hydroxylase and that the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait.

	Chronic diarrhoea as a dominating symptom in two children with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Two children with chronic diarrhoea as the dominating symptom of CTX are presented. Before and after therapy with orally administered chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg kg-1 24 h, in three divided doses) bile alcohol excretion in urine, serum cholestanol level, serum bile acid patterns and faecal bile acids were measured. All routine gastro-intestinal investigations before therapy were normal. Diarrhoea ceased immediately after starting treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Abnormal bile alcohol excretion in urine decreased rapidly during the first days and elevated serum cholestanol level normalized in 2 years.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis caused by two new mutations of the sterol-27-hydroxylase gene that disrupt mRNA splicing.
	In the present study we report two mutations of sterol-27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27 gene) found in Italian CTX patients. Proband T C is homozygous for a G-->A transition at the first nucleotide of intron 7 This mutation causes the formation of minute amounts of an abnormal mRNA, in which exon 6 joins directly to exon 8 with the skipping of exon 7. The exon 6-exon 8 junction results in a frame shift, downstream from the codon for Arg362, which generates a string of 28 novel amino acids preceding a premature termination codon. Proband C U is homozygous for a G-->C transversion at the last nucleotide of exon 3 This mutation, which changes the consensus sequence of the 5' donor splice site, is associated with barely detectable levels of sterol-27-hydroxylase mRNA, of normal size, in proband fibroblasts. As both mutations change the sites for two restriction enzymes, rapid methods were devised for the identification of the healthy carriers among the probands' family members and for the screening of these mutations in other CTX patients.

	PET analysis of a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting hemiparkinsonism.
	We describe a 34-year-old Japanese woman presenting gait difficulty and Achilles tendon swelling. The patient was diagnosed as having cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) based on the high serum cholestanol level and diminished enzymatic activity of 27-hydroxylase of fibroblasts from her skin. Her clinical presentation was atypical regarding the presence of hemiparkinsonism and absence of apparent cataract, dementia, and cerebellar ataxia. Although MRI studies could not detect any abnormality in the basal ganglia or midbrain, PET analysis using [18F]-6-fluoro-L-dopa revealed reduced uptake of dopamine into the putamen, suggesting the impairment of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas mimicking Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome: a case report.
	A 39 year old patient with cerebellar signs, juvenile cataracts, and dull normal intelligence had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas, diagnosed previously as Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was proved by a greatly increased excretion of bile alcohols in the patient's urine. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a sterol storage disorder due to an autosomal recessive inherited defect of sterol 27-hydroxylase characterised by high cholestanol concentration in multiple tissues. If tendon xanthomas are not present, a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis will often not be made, unless biochemical tests are performed. The clinical features of cerebrotendinous xanthomas strongly resembles Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome. Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome is a autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the triad cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, and mental retardation. Although a late onset after the first decade of life favours cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as the underlying disease, a definite distinction between cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas and Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome based on clinical presentation may be difficult. It is considered that some patients with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome reported in the medical literature had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas. This is of crucial clinical relevance, because, by contrast with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome, treatment for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is already available.

	Partial deletion of the gene encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase in a subject with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	An Italian subject with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was found to have a partial deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27 gene). Southern blot analysis revealed that this deletion (approximately 2 kb) spans from intron 6 to the 3' flanking (3'FLK) region, eliminating exons 7-9, the last three exons of CYP27 gene. No sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA was detected in proband cells, either by Northern blot analysis or by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This suggests that the mutant mRNA devoid of the exon encoding the whole untranslated sequence (exon 9) might be rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. We used inverse PCR to obtain a partial sequence of the 3'FLK region of the normal CYP27 gene; this allowed us to define the mechanism underlying the deletion. The established sequence was used to design suitable primers to perform step-wise sequences of a 1.7 kb segment of the 3'FLK region of the normal gene and of the deletion joint in the CTX patient. The analysis of the sequence

	A novel mutation in the cytochrome P450(27) (CYP27) gene caused cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Japanese family.
	In a Japanese family with CTX, we identified two points mutations in the CYP27 gene at different sites. One is a novel transversion, which substitutes G for C at Pro 368 (CCC) to Arg (CGC). The other is a transition, which substitutes A for G at Arg441 (CGG) to Gln (CAG), this being the same mutation that Kim et al. reported (1994. J. Lipid Res. 35: 1031 - 1039). Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the father and mother of this family, who themselves had no clinical manifestations of CTX, had the former and latter mutations heterozygously, respectively. On the other hand, the patients each had both mutations heterozygously. These results are highly suggestive, but not conclusive, that the newly identified transversion in the CYP27 gene accounts for the sterol 27-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.15) deficiency in these patients.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. A case report].
	We describe a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) who saw a Rheumatologist because of joint and muscle pain in the lower limbs. Clinical examination did not reveal any classic joint disease; however, tendon lesions and clumsy gait were noted. The patient presented with a swollen Achilles tendon bilaterally and a parapareto-spastic gait; Babinski sign was positive on the right side, and hyperreflexia of both lower limbs could be demonstrated. As bilateral cataracts were present, we have interpreted the aforementioned signs as CTX with spinal involvement; mean plasma cholesterol was increased, thus confirming the diagnosis. The primary biochemical abnormality of this disease is a defect in the synthesis of bile acids; therefore, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) has been tried, and beneficial effects following CDCA treatment, especially in the early stages of CTX, have been reported in the literature. We report this case because of the severity and the rarity of this disease, and also because of its hereditary transmission. Our aim is to underline the need of a precocious diagnosis, in order to prevent a further progression of the disease; this therapeutic goal can now be achieved, thanks to the therapeutic regimens recently developed.

	Japanese triplets with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are homozygous for a mutant gene coding for the sterol 27-hydroxylase (Arg441Trp).
	We present the first case of triplets with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). A C-to-T base change identified in the genomic DNA and cDNA encoding the sterol 27-hydroxylase led to replacement of arginine by tryptophan at position 441 (Arg441Trp) in the triplets. The triplets were homozygous and their mother was heterozygous for this mutant gene. The triplets exhibited an identical phenotypic expression, which was different from that of a sporadic CTX case with the same mutation.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a family study of sterol 27-hydroxylase mutations and pharmacotherapy.
	We examined the phenotypic characteristics, molecular genetics and optimal pharmacological treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in an English family with combined hyperlipidaemia. The proband presented in adulthood with classical clinical characteristics of CTX, a greater than tenfold elevation in plasma cholestanol and combined hyperlipidaemia. His brother also had typical features of CTX without the presence of dyslipidaemia. Genotyping revealed that the two brothers were compound heterozygotes for a novel missense mutation in exon 2 (R94Q) and for a recently described nonsense mutation in exon 5, of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). Analysis of all available family members revealed that hyperlipidaemia did not co-segregate with the presence of a CYP27 mutant allele. Trial of therapy showed that the lowest plasma sterol and triglyceride concentrations and cholestanol:cholesterol ratio were achieved with the combination of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 750 mg/day, a primary bile acid, and simvastatin 40 mg/day, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. CDCA alone and simvastatin alone significantly lowered plasma cholestanol concentration, but the decrease was greater with the former. After 1 year there was significant improvement in both cognitive and motor function with regression of tendon xanthomata on computerized tomography.

	Ocular and systemic manifestations of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	METHODS: Ten patients (group 1) of the University Hospital Nijmegen, with a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, were re-examined for detailed ocular and major clinical manifestations. Meanwhile, we looked for similar but undiagnosed cases in patients (group 2) who visited the Institute of Ophthalmology during a 12-month period. RESULTS: A diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis had been made in the patients of group 1 at an average age of 40 years (range, 33 to 48 years). Subsequently, six new cases (group 2) were diagnosed in patients 7 to 37 years old (average age, 18 years). Bilateral cataract was the major ocular manifestation in all 16 patients. Small irregular corticonuclear opacities, anterior polar cataracts, and dense posterior subcapsular cataracts were diagnosed at various ages (mean, 18 years; range, 4 to 40 years). Four patients showed clinical signs of optic neuropathy, whereas retinal function was normal in all patients. Other major clinical signs included a history of chronic diarrhea (since childhood), mental deterioration (mean age, 23 years), neurologic deterioration (mean age, 31 years), and tendon xanthomas (mean age, 37 years).

	Determination of the glucurono-conjugated position in bile alcohol glucuronides present in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The determination of the glucurono-conjugated position in three bile alcohol glucuronides secreted in bile of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was carried out by a nuclear magnetic resonance study. The bile sample was extracted with ethanol and chromatographed on an ion-exchange column, a reverse-phase partition column and a silica gel column to isolate glucurono-conjugates of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha 12 alpha, 23-tetrol, and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol. Proton and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the two biliary bile alcohol glucuronides, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol glucuronide and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol glucuronide were identical with those of the synthetic glucuronide 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha-O beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid and the isolated glucuronide 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-23-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid from urine of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, respectively. Hence, the glucurono-conjugated positions of the biliary 25-tetrol glucuronide and the biliary 23,25-pentol glucuronide were C-3 and C-23, respectively. By comparison of the 13C chemical shift data with that of the unconjugated bile alcohol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23-tetrol, the glucurono-conjugated position of the natural 23-tetrol glucuronide was determined to be C-23. Thus, the natural 23-tetrol glucuronide can be formulated as 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-23-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid.

	Gallium uptake in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a rare familial sterol storage disease, increased uptake of gallium-67 was observed in the tendon xanthomas. This is considered to have resulted from the tumour-like proliferation of histiocytic cells in the xanthomas. Abnormalities in the white matter of the cerebellum and the brain stem observed by X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not detected by 67Ga scintigraphy, possibly due to the small size of the CNS lesions.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis diagnosed after traumatic subdural haematoma.
	We report the case of a 34-year old man, who, after presenting with subacute traumatic subdural haematoma, was diagnosed as CTX. He presented a ten year history of progressive deterioration of cognitive functions, unsteadiness of gait and surgery for bilateral cataracts at age 21. Cholestanol level in serum was 120.7 mmol/liter, and cholestanol/cholesterol ratio 2.52%. Bile alcohols in urine were 23, 25-pentol: 2.2665 mg/mmol creatinine, 24, 25-pentol: 1.3226 mg/mmol creatinine, and 27-nor-24, 25-pentol: 0.7363 mg/mmol creatinine. Electrophysiological study was consistent with a mixed demyelinating and axonal neuropathy. The assessment of autonomic nervous system (ANS) showed a postganglionic cholinergic failure accompanying somatic peripheral neuropathy. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) demonstrated markedly low amplitude and poorly defined waves, and almost symmetrical peak V and I to V interpeak latency (IPL) slight delays. Two nodular, bilateral, symmetrical lesions, strongly suggestive of calcifications, in the cerebellar white matter on CT and MRI were noted. On T2-weighted images diffuse high signal lesions were found in the cerebellar white matter, and multiple, hyperintense cerebral foci of demyelination or gliosis. MRI study of the Achilles tendon showed neither enlargement of the tendon, nor areas of lipid deposits. After ten months of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (750 mg/d) the clinical course was unaffected and the neurophysiological measures, CT and MRI remained unchanged.

	Mitochondrial enzyme deficiency in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We report reduced respiratory chain enzyme activity in isolated muscle mitochondria and high levels of serum and CSF pyruvate and lactate in a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These findings raise the question of the pathogenetic role of mitochondrial dysfunction in this syndrome.

	Premature termination codon at the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene causes cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a French family.
	A new mutation creating an insertion of cytosine at position 6 in the cDNA, which is expected to result in a frameshift and a premature termination codon at codon 179, has been identified in a French family. The mutation creates a new site for the restriction endonuclease HaeIII.

	Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: report of three siblings.
	We report the existence of nephrocalcinosis (NC) and/or nephrolithiasis (NL) in three siblings with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Incomplete renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1 is also found in these three siblings after the evaluation of renal acidification function. Although the association of RTA with NC and/or NL is well known, they are rarely reported in CTX patients.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in the Israeli Druze: molecular genetics and phenotypic characteristics.
	A CYP27 nonsense mutation created by the deletion of cytosine376 has been identified in four Israeli Druze CTX patients residing in the same village. Molecular screening for this mutation in families of two probands revealed a total of 10 homozygotes and 28 heterozygotes whose clinical and biochemical characteristics are described. Overall, except for tendon xanthomas, most of the clinical manifestations progress with age. The CYP27 mutation was associated with modest differences in the levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). The distribution of plasma concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the CTX families was consistent with a polygenic model. A similar model that includes also the effects of the CYP27 genotypes was not better supported by the data. It may be concluded that, in CTX, the presence of a CYP27 mutation does not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins. Therefore, the reported increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in this disease must be related to other factors.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein disease): CT and MR findings.
	PURPOSE: To describe the CT and MR findings in the brain and spinal cord of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and to seek possible correlations between clinical, biochemical (cholestanol levels), and neuroimaging findings. METHODS: Ten patients with well-defined clinical and biochemical diagnoses of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis were examined. Brain CT was performed in eight cases. In all patients MR was obtained using spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences. In eight patients spine MR was also performed.

	Treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effects of chenodeoxycholic acid, pravastatin, and combined use.
	Treatments by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, and combination of the two drugs were attempted for 7 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CDCA treatment at a dose of 300 mg/day reduced serum cholestanol (67.3% reduction), lathosterol (50.8%), campesterol (61.7%) and sitosterol (12.7%). However, the sera of the patients changed to be "atherogenic"; total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were increased, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was decreased. Contrarily, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day improved the sera of the patients to be markedly "anti-atherogenic", but the reductions of cholestanol (30.4%), lathosterol (44.0%), campesterol (22.9%) and sitosterol (9.6%) were inadequate. Combined treatment with CDCA and pravastatin showed good overlapping of the effects of each drug alone. The sera of the patients were apparently more "anti-atherogenic" than those after CDCA treatment.

	Identification of new mutations in sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in Japanese patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
	In the present study two new different point mutations are described in the heme-ligand binding domain of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in three Japanese CTX patients and one CTX heterozygote. Two of the homozygotes as well as the heterozygote subject have a single base substitution of A for G at codon 441 [CGG (Arg) to CAG (Gln)]. Another homozygote has a transition of C to T at codon 441 [CGG (Arg) to TGG (Trp)]. These two different mutations result in two restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for the enzymes StuI or HpaII.

	Determination of the glucurono-conjugated position in bile alcohol glucuronides excreted in urine of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis by a nuclear magnetic resonance study.
	This paper describes the determination of the glucurono-conjugated position in two bile alcohol glucuronides excreted in urine of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis by a nuclear magnetic resonance study. The urine sample was extracted with reversed-phase resin, and chromatographed on a reversed-phase partition column and a silica gel column to isolate glucurono-conjugates of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23,25- pentol. Proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the natural tetrol glucuronide were identical with those of the chemically synthesized tetrol glucuronide, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha-O-beta-D- glucopyranosyluronic acid. Hence, the glucurono-conjugated position of the natural tetrol glucuronide was determined to be the C-3 position. By comparison of the 13C chemical shift data with that of the unconjugated pentol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 23,25-pentol, the glucurono-conjugated position of the natural pentol glucuronide was determined to be C-23. Thus the natural pentol glucuronide can be formulated as 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25- tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-23-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid. The difference in the glucurono-conjugated position between the 25-tetrol glucuronide and the 23,25-pentol glucuronide indicates that the former is not the biosynthetic precursor of the latter.

	A point mutation in the bile acid biosynthetic enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase in a family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	An examination was made of the cDNA encoding cytochrome P450 sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) in hepatic mitochondria, considered a defective enzyme inducing CTX, in a Japanese housewife afflicted with CTX and her family. The proposita and one of her brothers, who also had CTX symptoms and hypercholestanolemia, were found to be homozygotic, carrying a point mutation in the CYP27 gene at Arg104 (CGG) to Trp104 (TGG). The mutant position has a 100% conserved positive charge in all known vertebrate cytochrome P450s and even in bacterial cytochrome P450cam. The mother of the proposita and another brother were both free of CTX symptoms and were heterozygotic for the mutation, although their plasma cholesterol increased moderately. An increase in plasma cholestanol alone would, thus, not appear to be a direct cause of sterol storage in CTX, while CTX is strongly suggested to be caused by defects in both alleles of the CYP27 gene.

	Magnetic resonance imaging in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a prospective clinical and neuroradiological study.
	We describe MRI findings in 13 persons with typical clinical, EEG, CT and biochemical features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MRI showed brain (13/13) and cerebellar (12/13) atrophy and diffuse white matter hypodensity (4/13) presumably reflecting sterol infiltration with demyelination. Focal lesions were rare (2/13). Mass effect, edema or enhancement were not observed. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 750 mg/day orally improved neurological and biochemical abnormalities. MRI appears to be of little value in following improvement after treatment has begun. Otherwise, the MRI studies are very sensitive and useful in diagnosing early incomplete forms of CTX.

	Molecular genetics of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in Jews of north African origin.
	Recently, two mutations were shown to cause CTX in four Jewish families of Moroccan origin. An additional mutant allele, found in a Jewish family of Algerian origin is characterized here. Sequence analysis revealed a C to T transition at cDNA position 1037 which predicted a threonine to methionine substitution at residue 306 (designated T306M). It is highly suggestive, but not definitive, that this transition is the mutation causing CTX in this family. A search for additional cases from Jewish families of North African extraction identified five new families including 10 cases. The three sterol 27-hydroxylase gene mutations account for all 10 CTX families and their presence may suggest the existence of positive selective forces that lead to an increased prevalence of this relatively rare disease in Jews from North Africa.

	Treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with chenodeoxycholic acid in three siblings.
	We investigated the therapeutic effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) in three siblings with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. All three siblings had characteristic clinical manifestations, abnormal findings of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram, and high serum levels of cholestanol, cholesterol precursor (lathosterol), and plant sterols (campesterol, sitosterol). After treatment for one year, the serum levels of these sterols were decreased and some neurologic improvements in the pyramidal tract signs and cerebellar signs were noted. The electroencephalographic findings were markedly changed and normalized. However, mental defects and sensorimotor polyneuropathy still remained. No changes of neuroradiologic features could be detected. A longer period of treatment is required to estimate the overall effects of chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: molecular diagnosis enables presymptomatic detection of a treatable disease.
	We report an early molecular diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in a Jewish Moroccan family with two affected siblings. The proband displayed characteristic manifestations of the disease, whereas a younger brother, homozygous for the mutant allele, was asymptomatic. Clinical studies in the younger patient disclosed mild cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and abnormal EEG. Elevated plasma cholestanol levels were evident in both affected patients, with documented normal levels in the molecularly diagnosed heterozygous family members. Molecular characterization of affected CTX families provides early diagnosis and treatment of homozygotes in the presymptomatic state as well as identification of heterozygotes, which is crucial for genetic counseling and for prenatal diagnosis.

	[Magnetic resonance of the brain and Achilles tendon in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	We report a 31 year old patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who presented with dementia, tendinous xanthomas, cataracts, pyramidal involvement, cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. Cerebral CT scan demonstrated diffuse hypodensity in the white matter in both cerebellar hemispheres while MR detected additional focal alterations in both frontal lobes. MR study of the Achilles tendon showed a diffuse enlargement of the tendon with multiple areas of hypersignals in T1 and T2 demonstrative of the lipid deposits, interpossed between the isosignal zones that may correspond to the inflammatory reaction secondary to the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: pathophysiological study on bone metabolism.
	A condition of osteopenia in some cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) patients led us to investigate bone metabolism in 8 patients belonging to 5 families. Serum calcium, phosphate and vitamin D metabolites were in the normal range; a reduction in total body density and impairment of intestinal radiocalcium absorption were found in the majority of our patients.

	Treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis.
	We studied the effects of LDL-apheresis on the biochemical and clinical abnormalities of 5 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Levels of both cholestanol and cholesterol decreased to approximately 60% of those of pretreatment after one perfusion and gradually returned to their initial levels within 2 weeks. Improvement of clinical manifestations and regression of Achilles tendon xanthomas were detected after several perfusions, though dramatic changes could not be recognized. EEG abnormalities were improved immediately after LDL-apheresis in one patient.

	Osteoporosis and increased bone fractures in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Significant osteoporosis determined by skeleton radiography and bone densitometry was found in 15 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) whose mean age was 31 +/- 11 years. In three CTX patients, bone biopsies confirmed osteoporosis. Nine patients also sustained bone fractures following minimal trauma. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ([25-OHD] 14.6 +/- 6.6 ng/mL v [normal] 30.4 +/- 8.0 ng/mL; P < .001) and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ([24,25(OH)2D] 1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL v [normal] 2.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mL; P < .001) levels were low. Serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin were normal. Patients showed classic manifestations of CTX, including dementia, pyramidal and cerebellar insufficiency, peripheral neuropathy, cataracts, and tendon xanthomas associated with elevated serum cholestanol concentrations. These results demonstrate that extensive osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fractures are components of this inherited disease.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in three siblings from a Taiwanese family.
	We present and discuss the clinical and biochemical findings of three siblings with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, which has not been previously reported in Taiwan. Clinical features consisted of tendinous xanthomas, cataracts, mental defects, pyramidal signs, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and renal stones. Biochemical findings included normal serum cholesterol levels, high serum cholestanol levels and elevated serum cholestanol to cholesterol ratios. The serum levels of cholesterol precursor (lathosterol) and plant sterols (campesterol, sitosterol) were also elevated.

	Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials in the assessment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis before and after treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid: a preliminary study.
	We studied two unrelated patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, in whom clinical examination revealed central nervous system long tract involvement. Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs supporting the involvement of the long pathways. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials demonstrated central sensory and motor conduction abnormalities, which suggested distal degeneration of longer fibers, rather than scattered focal lesions in the CNS. In one of the patients the neurophysiological study was repeated 6 and 12 months after the beginning of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, showing a progressive improvement. Therefore, our

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis--a case of brain MRI abnormality and osteoporosis].
	A 37-year-old male with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis showed brain abnormal MRI findings and osteoporosis. His parents had no similar symptoms. He had mental retardation since childhood. Swelling of Achilles tendons was noticed at age 28, and gait disturbance appeared at age 34. Physical examination revealed bilateral cataracts and swelling of Achilles tendons. Neurologically, he showed mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia and spastic tetraparesis. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was diagnosed by marked elevations of serum cholestanol level (24.3 micrograms/ml) and cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (1.81%) as well as characteristic clinical manifestations. On brain MRI study, T2-weighted sequence showed bilateral focal lesions with high intensity signal in the globus pallidus and cerebellar white matter adjacent to the dentate nucleus, and T1-weighted sequence showed low to iso-intensity signal in the same regions. These findings suggested demyelination rather than xanthoma or lipid infiltration. Radiological examination showed mild osteoporosis of lumbar bone. However, serum levels of vitamin D3 and calcitonin were within normal range, and renal function was normal. Osteoporosis in this patient possibly resulted from disuse bone atrophy for several years. The combination therapy of oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin), and LDL apheresis slightly improved EEG abnormality and gait disturbance, but not brain MRI abnormality.

	Evoked potentials in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and effect induced by chenodeoxycholic acid.
	Evoked potentials are reported in 10 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, eight of whom had peripheral neuropathy. Four subjects showed delayed N13 to N20 interpeak latencies for arm somatosensory evoked potentials, and five showed moderately prolonged I to III and I to V interpeak latencies of brain-stem auditory evoked potentials. Six of seven patients showed marked delay and desynchronization of visual evoked potentials. All five patients undergoing transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex presented greatly delayed central motor conduction time, especially of the lower limbs. After treatment with chenodiol (750 mg/d for at least 2 years), there was a significant improvement in nerve conduction velocities, N13 to N20 interpeak latencies, and visual evoked potential latencies. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials remained unchanged.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: cranial CT and MRI studies in eight patients.
	We report the findings on cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their correlation with the clinical manifestations, disease severity and biochemical abnormalities in eight patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. CT revealed cerebral atrophy in seven cases, cerebellar atrophy in four and focal low density lesions in the cerebral white matter in two. T2-weighted MRI showed high signal lesions in the cerebral white matter, focal in four cases and diffuse in one, and in the globus pallidus in three patients, two of whom also had lesions in the cerebellar white matter. While severely affected patients showed variable CT and MRI abnormalities, our cases did not show the dramatic findings expected from the neurological manifestations. Diffuse lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter have been emphasized in previous reports, but in our study the focal lesions in the cerebral white matter were also present; the globus pallidus was frequently involved.

	A 40-year-old woman presented with bilateral juvenile cataract, tendinous xanthomas, intellectual deterioration, spastic tetraparesis, proprioceptive deficit and parkinsonian syndrome. A younger sister's clinical picture differed by the absence of xanthomas and the presence of a cerebellar syndrome. The diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was confirmed by a high concentration of plasma cholestanol and by urinary chromatography. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed some abnormalities in the hemispheric and cerebellar white matter. Under chenodesoxycholic therapy the biological abnormalities decreased while the clinical disturbances were unchanged.

	Electrophysiological studies in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Seven patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were studied by electrophysiological techniques. The percentages of abnormalities detected in nerve conduction studies and electroencephalograms were 28.6% (two patients) and 100%, respectively. All patients showed prolonged central conduction times in short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) by tibial nerve stimulation but normal SSEPs by median nerve stimulation. Brain stem auditory evoked potentials and visual evoked potentials were abnormal in three (42.9%) and four patients (57.1%), respectively. These electrophysiological parameters were correlated with the ratio of serum cholestanol to cholesterol concentration.

	Identification of (23S)-5 alpha-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol in urine of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	This paper describes the identification of a new bile alcohol possessing the 5 alpha-cholestane structure that was found in the urine of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The urine samples were extracted with reversed-phase resin, treated with beta-glucuronidase, and separated on silica gel and reversed-phase column chromatography. The new bile alcohol isolated was the second component of the urinary bile alcohols and was identified as (23S)-5 alpha-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol by means of gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies.

	Combined treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid and pravastatin improves plasma cholestanol levels associated with marked regression of tendon xanthomas in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We studied the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and a competitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, on clinical symptoms and sterol metabolism in a 36-year-old Japanese man with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). He had marked tendon xanthomas and mild dementia, with obvious electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities. He was treated for 2 years with CDCA alone (0.6 g/d) and then for a further year with the combination of pravastatin (10 mg/d) and CDCA (0.6 g/d). For the following year, he was given pravastatin alone, and then was returned to combined treatment again. The plasma cholestanol level before treatment was 3.12 mg/dL, which was 20 times above the control level. After CDCA alone, the plasma cholestanol was reduced to 1.96 mg/dL, and this was further reduced to 0.92 mg/dL by combination therapy with CDCA and pravastatin. However, after the discontinuation of CDCA, his cholestanol levels returned to the pretreatment levels despite the continuing of pravastatin treatment. When the combination therapy was restarted, his cholestanol level was once again markedly reduced. His clinical symptoms showed a close association with the plasma cholestanol level; the xanthomas regressed remarkably and the mental retardation improved in association with normalization of EEG findings during treatment with CDCA alone or in combination with pravastatin. However, during treatment with pravastatin alone, his tendon xanthomas enlarged again and slow waves reappeared on the EEG. Because inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor alone was not effective in causing a reduction of cholestanol, the increase in plasma cholestanol levels in CTX may not have been solely due to increased cholesterol synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

	[A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with spastic paraparesis, epilepsy, and bradykinesia].
	A 26-year-old female developed mental deterioration, general convulsion, cataract and spastic gait in order since her entrance into elementary school. A diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was made because of hypercholestanolemia. At the time of admission, cataract, a mild thickening of Achilles tendons, mental deterioration, spastic paraparesis, truncal ataxia, and bradykinesia were noted. Bilateral slowing of 2 to 7 Hz was recorded in EEG, and brain CT and MRI revealed mild cerebellar atrophy. HVA and 5-HIAA levels in CSF were low. Oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, 300 mg per day, resulted in improvement of bradykinesia and EEG abnormality, increase of HVA and 5-HIAA levels in CSF, and decrease of serum cholesterol level in two weeks. Bradykinesia observed in the present case is a rare clinical finding of CTX, and the improvement of bradykinesia soon after the treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid has not been reported yet. This case is important for elucidating the mechanism of neurological disorders in CTX.

	Mutations in the bile acid biosynthetic enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase underlie cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In two unrelated patients with CTX, we have identified different point mutations in the gene (CYP27) encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Transfection of mutant cDNAs into cultured cells results in the synthesis of immunoreactive sterol 27-hydroxylase protein with greatly diminished enzyme activity.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical and biochemical evaluation of eight patients and review of the literature.
	We present the clinical and laboratory findings of 8 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The clinical features consisted of a combination of bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomas, cataracts, low intelligence, pyramidal signs, cerebellar signs, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy, foot deformity, cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis, EEG abnormality, and increased CSF protein. Increased cholesterol was present in the serum, CSF and red cell membrane of all 8 patients. The bile of one patient with late age onset of the disease showed an attenuated production of bile acids and bile alcohols. Three of the 7 had obstruction and/or marked narrowing of the coronary arteries. Data on 136 patients reported throughout the world are reviewed.

	[Hypothyroidism with increased serum levels of cholestanol and bile alcohol--analogous symptoms to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	We reported a 53-year-old woman with hypothyroidism due to ectopic thyroid gland. She showed intellectual impairment, bilateral pyramidal tract sings, slight cerebellar signs, and degenerative changes of brain white matter on CT and MRI, which were similar to symptoms and signs in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). We found increases of serum cholestanol in the patient and additional 3 patients with hypothyroidism. Total bile alcohol was also increased in the serum of the patients. We speculate that hypothyroidism and CTX might have a similar pathophysiological background on the development of neurological complications and atherosclerosis.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: treatments with simvastatin, lovastatin, and chenodeoxycholic acid in 3 siblings.
	We report 3 sisters treated for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We treated one, with a severe neurologic form of the illness, with chenodeoxycholic acid, then lovastatin and simvastatin. These drugs had different efficacy and tolerance, but induced no clinical improvement. Her sisters, without neurologic symptoms, received chenodeoxycholic acid, which normalized the cholestanol level. Optimal treatment of this illness must begin before there is significant clinical symptomatology.

	Parkinsonism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	This report describes a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) accompanied by clinical manifestations of parkinsonism, including oily and masked face, marked akinesia, muscle rigidity and resting hand tremor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed high intensity areas on T2 weighted imaging, and slightly low intensity areas on T1 weighted imaging in the right globus pallidus and the left putamen. Cerebral cortical atrophy with slight ventricular dilatation and cerebellar atrophy were present as well. This is a case report of CTX which manifested parkinsonism. Parkinsonism may not be a coincidental manifestation in CTX, but rather represent a symptom of the same underlying diathesis.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as a multisystem disease mimicking premature ageing.
	The authors report the clinical findings in 10 Italian cases of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). In addition to the classical neurological manifestations, the presence of psychiatric symptoms and osteopenia is stressed. Chronic treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid resulted in decreased plasma cholestanol levels and improvement of some central and peripheral neurophysiological parameters including EEG, VEP, SEP and conduction velocities. Due to the presence of cataracts, ischemic heart disease, premature atherosclerosis, mental deterioration and osteoporosis, usually found in old age, CTX can be considered a useful model of premature ageing.

	[Peripheral neuropathy in a sporadic case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	The authors report the case of a 22-year old man presenting with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who developed peripheral neuropathy. Nerve biopsy showed evidence of demyelination and remyelination, suggesting axonal degeneration. The neurological symptoms improved after treatment with chenodesoxycholic acid.

	Reduction of urinary bile alcohol excretion and serum cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis after oral administration of deoxycholic acid.
	Deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were administered alternately to four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. During this oral therapy serum cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols were determined. Both showed a marked decrease after the start of the two different therapies. It can be concluded that not only chenodeoxycholic acid but also deoxycholic acid is able to suppress endogenous human bile acid synthesis, which is in accordance with other experiments describing the effect of feeding of various bile acids on endogenous bile acid synthesis.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with cholestanolaemia--involvement of five individuals in a Malay family.
	Involvement of five members of a family is presented. The clinical features, laboratory and pathologic findings are discussed. Tendinous and tuberous xanthomatosis, bilateral cataracts, cerebral impairment and raised serum cholestanol are the salient features. We believe this is the first report of CTX in Malaysia.

	A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. II: The sterol content of a cataractous lens.
	The cholestanol content of a cataractous lens nucleus from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and found to be 0.27 micrograms per mg freeze-dried lens tissue. The cholestanol-cholesterol ratio of 1.7% in the lens nucleus was similar to that in the serum of the CTX patient. The cholestanol content and cholestanol-cholesterol ratio in the CTX lens were approximately four-fold and six-fold greater respectively than the mean levels found in three senile cataractous lens nuclei analysed simultaneously for comparative purposes.

	Identification of short side chain bile acids in urine of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Urine from patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was found to contain a number of minor bile acids along with three major bile acids, 7-epicholic acid, norcholic acid, and cholic acid. The following minor bile acids were identified by combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry: 7-ketobisnordeoxycholic acid; 12-ketobisnorchenodeoxycholic acid; 7-ketonordeoxycholic acid; 12-ketochenodeoxycholic acid; 7-ketodeoxycholic acid; 12-ketochendeoxycholic acid; bisnorcholic acid; allonorcholic acid; allocholic acid; 1 beta-hydroxybisnorcholic acid; 1 beta-hydroxynorcholic acid; 1 beta-hydroxycholic acid; 2 beta-hydroxybisnorcholic acid; 2 beta-hydroxy-norcholic acid; 2 beta-hydroxycholic acid. The presence of C22 and C23 bile acids in urine of the CTX patients suggests that bile alcohols having a hydroxyl group at C22 or C23 in the side chain may be further degraded to these bile acids.

	[Parkinsonism associated with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	Two sibling cases of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with parkinsonism were reported. One was a woman of 39 years old, and another was her sister of 36 years old. In both cases, febrile convulsion appeared on 1.5 year old, and mental deterioration, ataxic -spastic gait, cataract and swelling of Achilles tendons developed in order since entrance into elementary school. Five years ago, while they were in hospital at the first time, they were diagnosed as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis by mental disturbance, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract sign, histologically xanthomatous granuloma of Achilles tendons and hypercholestanolemia and family history of autosomal recessive trait. After the second admission, parkinsonism was noticed in addition to those findings above. Parkinsonism consisted of the following: Resting tremor of parkinsonian type, mild muscle rigidity of forearm and intrinsic-plus hand were observed in the elder sister, and generalized severe rigidity and bradykinesia in the younger sister. In both cases, brain CT showed the pontocerebellar atrophy, and the bilateral low density area in corona radiata, posterior portion of internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, tegmentum of midbrain and deep matter of cerebellum. Brain MRI also showed abnormal intensity in the same regions as on the brain CT. Administration of anti-parkinsonian drugs was challenged for the parkinsonism. Oral L-dopa test (500 mg) moderately improved parkinsonism in both cases. Therapy of diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (10 mg/day) entirely inhibited parkinsonian tremor and mild rigidity in the elder sister but was less effective for severe rigidity in the younger sister than administration of L-dopa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical, electrophysiological and nerve biopsy findings, and response to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.
	A 30-year-old patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was studied over a 6-year period. The clinical manifestations were cataracts, intellectual deterioration, ataxia, palatal and pharyngeal myoclonus, corticospinal tract damage and an electrophysiologically demonstrated sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity was slowed. Sural nerve biopsy revealed reduced densities of both myelinated and unmyelinated axons and teased fibres showed evidence of axonal regeneration and some remyelination. The loss of myelinated nerve fibres particularly affected those of larger diameter, thus contributing to the slowing of nerve conduction. Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment for two separate periods of 10 and 6 months each increased nerve conduction velocity. This electrophysiological improvement was not matched by detectable clinical neurological improvement.

	[Zonular juvenile cataract and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
	The present paper describes two cases, with the same type of zonular cataract associated with the rare disease of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The disease is characterized by lipopexia in the Achilles' tendons, neurologic symptoms and low IQ. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The physiopathology and biochemistry of the disease are discussed with reference to recent publications.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	A case report on a 23-year-old female patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is presented. From 8 years of age, the patient clinically showed multiple xanthoma masses on both knees, both heels, and the nasal bridge, juvenile cataracts, multiple abnormal neurologic dysfunctions, and dementia. The level of cholestanol in urine, serum, and xanthoma mass tissues was increased, as determined by capillary gas chromatography.

	[A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with convulsive seizures].
	A 35 year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of convulsive seizures. His parents are first cousins. No other members of his family have similar symptoms. He showed mental retardation since childhood. At age 14, he had generalized convulsive seizures that were intractable. Bilateral cataracts were found and extracted at age 18. He noticed bilateral swellings at Achilles tendons at around 25 years of age. Physical examination revealed bilateral swellings of Achilles tendons. Neurologically, he showed poor intellectual ability, hyperreflexia with positive Babinski's sign and cerebellar ataxia. Marked elevations of cholestanol level (53.84 micrograms/ml; normal: 2.71 +/- 0.81, n = 17) and cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (2.20%; normal: 0.16 +/- 0.05, n = 17) were detected in serum. EEG showed abnormal background activities with bursts of high voltage slow theta activities. MRI study showed high intensity lesions in globus pallidus and multiple lesions in white matter with long spin echo sequence. Oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid improved EEG findings, serum cholestanol level and convulsive seizures. However, the MRI abnormalities remained unchanged, which suggested irreversible brain damage. We reviewed the previous reports of 144 cases of CTX. Fourteen cases had convulsive seizures. We stress that CTX is one the causes of symptomatic epilepsy.

	Use of positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry for rapid identification of a bile alcohol glucuronide isolated from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients.
	The identification of a major biliary and plasma bile alcohol glucuronide, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol-3-0-beta-D-glucuronide, present in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) patients, was investigated by positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). The spectrum was characterized by abundant ions formed by attachment of a proton, [M + H]+, or of alkali ions, [M + Na]+ and [M + 39K]+, to the glucuronide salt. These ions allowed an unambiguous deduction of the molecular weight of the sample. It is suggested that FAB-MS could be used in the rapid diagnosis of CTX.

	Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	This reports a 40 year old man with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who had bilateral cataracts, enlarged Achilles tendons, progressive dementia, gait disturbance and peripheral neuropathy. Electroencephalography, electromyography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebral, cerebellar and cervical cord atrophy and white matter involvement in the cerebrum and cerebellum correlating well with the clinical findings. To date there has been one previous report of MRI of the brain in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and none of the spinal cord.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical and MRI study (a case report).
	We report a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) presenting with dementia, spastic tetraparesis and an unreported akinetic-rigid syndrome. Computed tomography (CT) showed only cerebellar abnormalities while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected additional pallidal and mesencephalic focal alterations. MRI findings, but not CT, correlated with the clinical picture.

	Type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia masquerading as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We describe an adult patient with type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia, presenting with Achilles tendon xanthomas, cataracts, dementia, ataxia, pyramidal tract signs, and peripheral neuropathy, which are commonly seen in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). However, the diagnosis of CTX was excluded on the basis of the cholestanol level and the normal cholestanol/cholesterol ratio in his serum and tendon. The pathomechanism for some of the clinical manifestations in type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia and CTX might be caused by a common biochemical disturbance.

	Chenodeoxycholic acid normalizes elevated lipoprotein secretion and catabolism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In an untreated patient, total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were found to be low (134 +/- 11 and 78 +/- 8 mg/dl, respectively). The production rate (PR) and fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of very low density (VLDL) apolipoprotein B (apoB) were, however, both markedly increased (34.7 mg/kg per day and 13.7 pools/day, respectively vs. 15.1 +/- 5.0 mg/kg per day and 6.2 +/- 3.8 pools/day in controls) while the PR and FCR of LDL apoB were moderately elevated (16.3 mg/kg per day and 0.65 pools/day, respectively vs. 12.9 +/- 1.2 mg/kg per day and 0.52 +/- 0.10 pools/day in controls). After 1 month of 750 mg/day of chenodeoxycholic acid, the FCR and PR of both VLDL and LDL apoB became normal while total plasma cholesterol increased significantly to 145 +/- 18 mg/dl. In a second patient who had been receiving 750 mg/day of chenodeoxycholic acid for 6 months lipoprotein kinetics were normal. These parameters did not change when the subject was switched to 750 mg/day ursodeoxycholic acid.

	[Effect of LDL-apheresis on a case of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis].
	From the point of view that cholestanol is involved mainly in LDL-cholesterol (1.019 less than d less than 1.063), we used this LDL-apheresis in the aim of reducing the cholestanol in 58 years old woman with typical sign and symptoms of CTX. The levels of serum cholestanol and cholesterol before the treatment with LDL-apheresis, were 10.7 micrograms/ml and 175 mg/dl respectively. Also the ratio of cholestanol/cholesterol indicated 0.63. By the first procedure of apheresis, the level of cholestanol was markedly decreased to 5.2 micrograms/ml (50%). Several LDL-apheresis treatments were carried out once a month. During 5 months treatments, neurological deterioration was arrested, dementia which included disorientation and recent-memory loss, cleaned a little. Although the xanthomas did not decrease in size, this patients was better oriented to person, place, time and was able to speak rationally, 2nd her cerebellar dysfunction revealed improvement. From our new experiments-we believe that the LDL-apheresis offers the strong hope of preventing the progress on cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

	Membranocystic lesion in the brain in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Histochemical and ultrastructural study with evidence of its ceroid nature.
	A case is described of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with purely neurological manifestations. Cholestanol deposition in both affected and unaffected brain regions was markedly increased, reaching 18.5-20.8% of the sterol fraction. The unilateral lesions localized in the basal ganglia and cerebellar white matter featured perivascular accumulation of foam cells containing apolar lipid and ceroid. Necrosis with lipid-rich debris was a frequent finding often accompanied by prominent collagen deposition. Within these lesions there were numerous refractile thick membranes which, according to lipid histochemical techniques, could be qualified as ceroid-type lipopigment. It is suggested that the ceroid membranes arise extracellularly directly from the lipid-rich debris. Ultrastructurally, they were composed of convolutes of highly organized trilaminar membranes about 15 nm thick similar to those seen in intracellular ceroid granules. The membranes were embedded in an amorphous substance of low or medium density and were identical in their general appearance, stainability and fine structure to the membranocystic lesion in Nasu-Hakola disease and to the extracellular ceroid in atherosclerotic plaques.

	Pregnancy in women with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): high risk condition for fetus and newborn infant?
	We investigated 38 CTX patients and most of their families. The possibility of a high risk situation for the fetus and/or the apparently healthy newborn infant born to CTX mothers and female carriers of the gene is discussed for genetic counseling purposes and in view of available treatment.

	Central motor and sensory conduction in adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and tabes dorsalis.
	Central motor and sensory conduction was studied by percutaneous electrical stimulation of brain and spinal cord and by somatosensory evoked potential techniques respectively, in patients with adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1-associated myelopathy and tabes dorsalis. The results were all consistent with clinical and neuropathological findings in these disorders. Conductions in the corticospinal tract and posterior column could be evaluated separately with these two techniques. Percutaneous electrical stimulation technique would be useful for investigating conduction in the corticospinal tract in patients with spinal cord disorders.

	Psychiatric disorders in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The authors describe four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and prominent psychiatric symptoms. In three of these patients appropriate diagnosis and treatment were delayed for years because the presence of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was not recognized. Early recognition of this potentially lethal disease is important because both the psychiatric and neurological symptoms respond to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a review of biochemical findings of the patient population in The Netherlands.
	This study gives a review of the results obtained from biochemical investigations of 20 patients in The Netherlands suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, an inborn error of metabolism in bile acid synthesis. Diagnosis can best be established by determining the excretion of urinary bile alcohols, in particular 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha,23,25-pentol, in urine by means of capillary gas chromatography. Measurement of serum cholestanol levels or serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratios, commonly used for establishing cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, are not reliable. The effectiveness of the different therapies, i.e. administration of bile acids, can be evaluated by monitoring the urinary excretion of bile alcohols.

	[Van Bogaert's cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. A study of 3 cases].
	The authors report three observations of cerebro-tendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The three patients presented tendinous xanthoma and cataract. The neurologic disorders were different in each case. The first one, a 43 years old woman suffered from dementia, ataxia and pseudobulbar palsy: CT scan showed cerebellar hypodense lesions. After the apparition of bulbar signs ans cachexia she died at 45. The second patient, a 39 years old man had an ataxia and mild psychiatric disorders. He was stabilized with a treatment of chenodesoxycholic acid. The third one, a 49 years old women suffered only from tendinous xanthoma, cataract, and had no neurological disorder. His plasmatic cholestanol level was high. CTX is a recessive deficit of the hepatic 26 hydroxylase with deposits of abnormal metabolites in tendons, crystalline lenses and central nervous system. Reviewing the 44 observations of CTX in the literature, the authors define the genetical, clinical, biochemical and therapeutical aspects of CTX, and underline the necessity of a early diagnosis with cholestanol dosage, before the apparition of neurological disorders and the short terminal phase. CTX is a rare but fortunately treatable neurolipidosis.

	Polyneuropathy with lipid deposits in Schwann cells and axonal degeneration in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The present paper is a histological, histochemical and electron microscopic study of biopsied specimens from both right and left Achilles tendon, sural nerve and gastrocnemius muscle in a case of peripheral neuropathy with decreased sensory conduction velocity within a cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis confirmed biochemically in a 29-year-old woman. The tendon specimens contained large deposits of complex, non-homogeneous lipids, distributed intra- and extracellularly. The right sural nerve specimen showed a very severe neuropathy with massive diffuse myelinated fiber loss, presence of foamy macrophages and lipid droplets in Schwann cells. Segmental de- and remyelination was noted in 17% of the teased myelinated fibers. No onion bulbs were observed. Two years later, the left sural nerve specimen revealed a mild diffuse myelinated fiber loss, a more active segmental de- and remyelination (23%) without onion bulbs, and an active regeneration. Lipid storage aspects were absent. The gastrocnemius muscle specimens exhibited slight alterations of neurogenic origin. The pathogenesis of this neuropathy is discussed.

	Low-density lipoprotein metabolism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The present study, therefore, was carried out to examine the metabolism of LDL in a 58-year-old black man with CTX. This particular patient had an LDL-cholesterol in the mid-normal range (149 +/- 6 mg/dL). Nonetheless, his fractional catabolic rate (FCR) for LDL-apolipoprotein (apo-LDL) was 0.45 pools/d, which was increased compared to 15 aged-matched men (FCR, 0.30 +/- 0.01 pools/d). His production rate for apo-LDL (18.5 mg/kg-d) also was increased compared to those of middle-aged men (13.5 +/- 2.5 mg/kg-d). Since the underlying defect in CTX can be reversed by administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (chenodiol), the patient was treated with chenodiol (250 mg 4X daily), and measurements of LDL kinetics were repeated. During chenodiol therapy, his LDL-cholesterol concentration rose significantly to 165 +/- 12 mg/dL; his FCR for apo-LDL fell to 0.29 pools/d; and his production rate of apo-LDL declined to 14.4 mg/kg-d.

	Accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effect of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.
	The serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as well as those of cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one were found to be markedly elevated in the three patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Treatment of two of the patients with chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the serum levels of the two steroids by more than 80%. The concentration of cholestanol was reduced by 72% in one patient and by 48% in the other. The possibility is discussed that accumulation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is secondary to accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one.

	Abnormal urinary bile acids in a patient suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis during oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid.
	The urinary bile acid profile, obtained by capillary gas chromatography, of a patient suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and treated with ursodeoxycholic acid demonstrated, besides the occurrence of 23-norcholic acid and (23R)-hydroxycholic acid (as a consequence of this disease), six additional unknown bile acids and three known bile acids, viz. ursodeoxycholic acid, hyocholic acid and omega-muricholic acid. The structure of two of the unknown bile acids were elucidated and proven by organic syntheses. These were 23-norursodeoxycholic acid and 3 beta-ursodeoxycholic acid. The structures of three bile acids were tentatively elucidated as being 1 beta-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid, 21-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid and 22-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid, and the possibility that the structure of the remaining bile acid is that of 5-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid is discussed. Two of these bile acids (1 beta-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid and 5-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid) also occurred in urine of a healthy individual during oral ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, whereas 23-norcholic acid, 23-norursodeoxycholic acid, (23R)-hydroxycholic acid, 21-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid and 22-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid were only present in urine of the patient suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The metabolism of ursodeoxycholic acid, both in the normal state and in the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, is discussed.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): a clinical survey of the patient population in The Netherlands.
	The clinical features and additional investigations of 20 Dutch patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), an inborn error of metabolism in bile acid synthesis, are described. The onset was in the second or third decade. The clinical picture at the time of examination consisted of a combination of two or more of the following signs: cataract, xanthoma of a tendon, mental deterioration, pyramidal tract signs, cerebellar signs and epilepsy. Mental retardation was reported in patients. CT-scanning showed cerebellar hypodensity in 8 out of 16 patients but this feature did not correlate well with cerebellar signs. The EEG was abnormal in all but one patient. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid resulted in a normalization of EEG and biochemical abnormalities but not of the clinical signs. Cholic acid was equally effective but had much less side effects. The importance of a diagnosis in early life is stressed as well as the examination of clinically unaffected heterozygous relatives.

	Configuration at C-25 in 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25,26-pentol excreted by patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: circular dichroism and 13C-NMR studies.
	The configuration at C-25 in 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha,25,26-pentol isolated from the bile and feces of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomtosis (CTX) was determined from the lanthanide-induced circular dichroism (CD) Cotton effects and 13C-NMR measurements. Under anhydrous conditions, CD spectra of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha,25,26-pentol in the presence of Eu(fod)3 exhibited a large induced negative Cotton effect at 320 nm.

	Quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450-linked monooxygenase system: NADPH-hepatoredoxin reductase, hepatoredoxin, and cytochrome P-450s27 in livers of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We studied the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450-linked monooxygenase system in livers of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The three components of this system, which catalyzes steroid 27-hydroxylation, NADPH-hepatoredoxin reductase, hepatoredoxin, and cytochrome P-450s27, were stained on a nitrocellulose sheet with antibodies against NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, and cytochrome P-450scc, respectively, from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria. The concentrations of hepatoredoxin in the patients were not significantly different from a control, but the level of NADPH-hepatoredoxin reductase was three times that of the control. Cytochrome P-450s27 was not detected in the patients, but it was present (22.8 pmol/mg of protein) in the control liver. This implies that a defect of mitochondrial cytochrome P-450s27 prevents steroid 27-hydroxylation of hepatic mitochondria in patients with CTX.

	Capillary gas chromatography of urine samples in diagnosing cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	A patient is described with many clinical features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), but with only slightly elevated cholestanol/cholesterol concentration ratios in serum and xanthomatous tissue. However, with capillary gas chromatographic determinations of urinary bile acids and bile alcohols we demonstrated the typical biochemical abnormalities as seen in CTX patients. This article emphasizes the value of urinary capillary gas chromatography as a specific test to establish the diagnosis of CTX and to monitor the biochemical effectivity of the different treatment regimens.

	Increased (23R)-hydroxylase activity in patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, resulting in (23R)-hydroxylation of bile acids.
	Urine samples of two treated patients, receiving chenodeoxycholic acid, were investigated to see whether this administered bile acid was partly converted into 23-hydroxychenodeoxycholic acid. One patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid for 1 month and subsequently with chenodeoxycholic acid, and the urinary excretion of both (23R)-hydroxychenodeoxycholic acid and (23R)-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid were followed. Indeed, all three patients excreted (23R)-hydroxylated chenodeoxycholic acid during oral treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, and the patient treated with ursodeoxycholic acid excreted (23R)-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholic acid. During treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid the excretion of (23R)-hydroxychenodeoxycholic acid increases at first and later on decreases markedly.

	Bile acid profiles in bile, urine, and feces of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Bile acid profiles of bile, urine, and feces obtained from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis on the same day have been analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after fractionation into groups by mode of conjugation by an ion-exchange chromatography. The predominant biliary bile acid was cholic acid conjugated with glycine and taurine. Lesser amounts of the amino acid conjugates of chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, allocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid, and of unconjugated norcholic acid and allonorcholic acid were also present in the bile. The major fecal bile acid was 7-epicholic acid. Relatively large amounts of bile acids were excreted in the urine. Unconjugated 7-epicholic acid, norcholic acid, allonorcholic acid, and cholic acid predominated.

	Chronic demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Three siblings with chemically proved cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presented with typical neurological manifestations of dementia and spinocerebellar disorder. Electrodiagnostic tests revealed demyelinating neuropathy in all three. Sural nerve biopsies showed loss of myelinated large fibers, marked Schwann cell proliferation, and onion bulb formation. Teased-fiber preparations confirmed the occurrence of segmental demyelination and remyelination.

	Biochemical diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis using reversed phase thin layer chromatography.
	When serum cholestanol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) patients was quantified by TLC, GC-MS, and GC, the correlation among the three methods was found to be approximately 1:1:1. It was found that the present method was useful for the primary diagnostic screening of CTX because of its simplicity and because many samples could be analyzed at one time.

	Bile alcohol profiles in bile, urine, and feces of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Bile alcohols in bile, urine, and feces of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis have been analyzed by a combination of capillary gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry after fractionation into groups according to mode of conjugation. The presence of at least 18 bile alcohols, which were excreted mainly as glucurono-conjugates in bile and urine, and as unconjugated forms in feces, was demonstrated. The following bile alcohols were identified with certainty by direct comparison with reference compounds: 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol; (23R)-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23-tetrol; 5 alpha- and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24-tetrols; 5 alpha- and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrols; 27-nor-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,25-pentol; (22R)-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,22,25-pentol; (23R)- and (23S)-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha, 12 alpha,23,25-pentols; 3 alpha,12 alpha,25-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-7-one; (24R)- and (24S)-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,25-pentols; 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25,26-pentol. Although the bile alcohol profile in urine was quite different from those in bile and feces, the determination of urinary bile alcohols as well as of biliary and fecal bile alcohols could be used for diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

	Magnetic resonance imaging in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed findings of demyelination in the cerebral white matter, which was also hypodense on CT. The MRI abnormality seemed to be clinically significant in this patient with progressive dementia and abnormal gait.

	Bile acid therapies applied to patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, an inborn error of metabolism in bile acid synthesis, were given oral treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid and taurocholic acid. The effectiveness of the different therapies was evaluated by measuring the urinary excretion of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol, which should decrease, when the administered bile acid is able to suppress endogenous bile acid synthesis.

	Treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with chenodeoxycholic acid.
	We describe a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who was treated for one year with chenodeoxycholic acid. Modest clinical improvement was accompanied by marked improvement in visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Improved central nervous system function coincided with return of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid cholestanol levels to normal.

	Peripheral neuropathy in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	We performed a sural nerve biopsy in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) because of electrophysiologic evidence of peripheral neuropathy. The sections showed a striking loss of myelinated axons, the distribution of which suggested a compressive and/or ischemic process. Biochemical analysis disclosed large amounts of cholestanol, a cholesterol derivative that characteristically accumulates in CTX. However, the biochemical abnormality was not associated with any obvious structural alterations in the myelin lamellae or with abnormal storage material in Schwann's cells.

	Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry in the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Urine from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was extracted with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and the extract was analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The spectra indicated the presence of glucuronidated bile alcohols with four to seven hydroxyl groups. The method is simple and rapid and is suggested as an aid in the diagnosis of CTX with possible application to prenatal diagnosis.

	Effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on biliary and urinary bile acids and bile alcohols in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; monitoring by high performance liquid chromatography.
	Biliary and urinary bile alcohol and bile acid composition has been determined by high performance liquid chromatography in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis before and after treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Most of the bile acids and bile alcohols in the bile and urine were separated in less than 30 min using a radial pack C18 muBondapak 5 micron particle size column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water-methanol-acetic acid 70:70:20:1 (v/v/v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and a refractive index detector. Before treatment, cholic acid (49%) and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol (27%) were the major biliary bile acid and bile alcohol, respectively, but were not detected in the urine of five patients. 5 beta-Cholestane-pentols were, instead, the major urinary bile alcohols with 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23 xi, 25-pentol (56%) predominating. Whereas 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24S,25-pentol was not detected in the bile, it was isolated in the urine of all patients (27%). The only urinary bile acid isolated by high performance liquid chromatography was nor-cholic acid. After 1 month of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, 0.75 g/day, chenodeoxycholic acid became the major bile acid in the bile of all patients (71%) along with its metabolite, ursodeoxycholic acid (21%). Cholic acid and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol were drastically reduced and were only 3% each. The excretion of 5 beta-cholestane-pentols in the urine was also drastically reduced from 130 mg/day to 15 mg/day.

	Long-term treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with chenodeoxycholic acid.
	We studied the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid in 17 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Before treatment, all subjects were symptomatic, with Achilles tendon xanthomas (in 15 of 17), cataracts (in 12 of 17), dementia (in 13 of 17), pyramidal-tract signs (in all 17), cerebellar dysfunction (in 13 of 17), mild peripheral neuropathy (in 7 of 17), electroencephalographic abnormalities (in 10 of 13), and abnormal cerebral computerized axial tomographic scans (in 10 of 12). After at least one year of chenodeoxycholic acid treatment (750 mg per day), dementia cleared in 10 subjects, and pyramidal and cerebellar signs disappeared in 5 and improved in another 8. Peripheral neuropathy was no longer detected in six. The electroencephalogram became normal in five and showed fewer abnormalities in another three subjects. Cerebral computerized axial tomographic scans improved in seven patients; the changes included the disappearance of a cerebellar xanthoma in one case. Concomitantly, mean plasma cholestanol levels declined threefold, and abnormal bile acid synthesis was suppressed.

	Capillary gas chromatographic determinations of urinary bile acids and bile alcohols in CTX patients proving the ineffectivity of ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.
	Urine samples and serum samples of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were investigated by means of capillary gas chromatography, both before and during oral treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and the results compared with those obtained during chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) therapy. The predominantly excreted bile alcohol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol and two abnormal bile acids, i.e. 23-norcholic acid and 23-hydroxycholic acid were determined. In addition, the serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratio was determined. Whereas previous experiments demonstrated that the urinary excretion of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol and the abnormal bile acids decreased within a few weeks during CDCA therapy, the present study shows that their urinary excretions remain essentially the same during UDCA treatment. In contrast to the decrease in the serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratio during CDCA therapy, this ratio remains essentially the same during UDCA therapy. It is therefore concluded that, in contrast to CDCA therapy, UDCA treatment is not effective in the treatment of CTX.

	Absolute configuration at carbon 23 of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol excreted by patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Absolute configuration at C-23 of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol, one of the bile alcohols isolated from the patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, was unequivocally determined as 23S by conversion of a key intermediate, (23S)-5 beta-cholest-25-ene-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23-tetrol to either the bile alcohol of known absolute configuration, (23R)-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23-tetrol, or the naturally occurring 23,25-pentol.

	Neuroaxonal pathology of central and peripheral nervous systems in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
	We studied three siblings and one unrelated patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Of two unrelated patients, we examined biopsies of sural nerve, soleus muscle, and achilles tendon. We also performed neurophysiologic investigations. Another patient died, and a postmortem examination of both brain and spinal cord was made. It was concluded that both the central and the peripheral nervous system were involved in CTX, but the peripheral system only to a slight degree, and that the pathology was predominantly neuroaxonal rather than demyelinating in character.

6679948
	Identification of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25, 26-pentol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	An unrecognized pentahydroxy bile alcohol has been isolated from the bile and feces of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Its structure, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25, 26-pentol has been deduced by spectroscopic methods and confirmed by comparison with a synthetic analog.

	Depression in a patient with dementia secondary to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The occurrence of depression in a patient with pre-existing dementia, associated with a rare neurological disorder, is described. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a genetically transmitted disease that is associated with deposition of cholestanol in the central nervous system and Achilles tendons. A focus on the often unusual presentation of combined major depression and dementia is offered as well as the interaction of genetic disorders and psychiatric symptoms. The diagnostic and treatment approach to these patients is discussed in regard to this reported case. Also, there is a review of the importance of recognition of early signs and symptoms of both depression in demented patients and evidences of presenile dementia because the prospects of treatability and reversibility should be a prime consideration for these disorders. This case report illustrates the potential for effectiveness of psychiatric interventions for patients with neurological and genetic disorders.

	Diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and effect of chenodeoxycholic acid therapy by analysis of urine using capillary gas chromatography.
	By means of capillary gas chromatography urine samples of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were investigated before and during treatment by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid. The occurrence of various conjugated bile alcohols, presumably glucuronides, was demonstrated, the major compound being 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23 xi, 25-pentol. In the bile acid fraction norcholic acid and hydroxycholic acid were shown to be present in considerable amounts. In this way the presence of CTX can be demonstrated conclusively. After chenodeoxycholic acid therapy the excretion of both abnormal bile acids as well as of bile alcohols rapidly decreased within a few weeks, showing the effectiveness of the treatment. By early discovery and subsequent therapy it may be possible to prevent the onset of the detrimental symptoms such as mental deficiency, caused by the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in CTX patients.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical and laboratory study of 2 cases.
	The authors of the present communication report 2 cases in siblings with parental consanguinity. They showed mental impairment and cataract, and multiple xanthomas; in 1 case, pyramidal signs were detected in the 4 limbs associated with a rise of the vibration sense thresholds in the feet. The diagnosis was confirmed in both cases by greatly increased cholestanol levels in the blood serum, bile and in a tendon xanthoma. Cholesterol concentrations in the blood serum and bile were normal although increased in the xanthoma. One case had a gallstone. Computerized tomography showed hyperdense nodules in the cerebellar hemispheres of one patient, and a calcified parietal nodule in his sister. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is discussed. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is in course in both patients.

	Study of a family with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis. No HLA linkage, but an informative recombination between HLA-B and Bf.
	A large family with three children affected with the autosomal recessive disease of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) was studied for class I (HLA-A,B,C) and class II antigens (HLA-DR,D,SB), properdin factor B and glyoxalase. The extensive typing revealed an informative cross-over between HLA-B and Bf, indicating that Bf is located centromeric to the HLA-B locus and segregated in this family with HLA-D/DR. The parents in this family were first cousins and their parents were also first cousins. Three of their four haplotypes share B14, BfS, DR1, Dx and SB4 and may be identical by descent. The three affected children carried among them all four parental haplotypes, indicating that close linkage of the CTX locus to HLA is unlikely.

	A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effects of ursodeoxycholic acid administration on serum bile acids and cholestanol.
	In this paper, a 50-year-old man with typical signs and symptoms of CTX is described. Serum cholestanol and chelesterol concentrations were 17.9-28.6 micrograms/ml and 109-153 mg/dl, respectively. The determination of non-sulfated bile acid concentration in the serum assayed by mass fragmentography disclosed an abnormal profile. The concentration of cholic acid (0.30-0.52 microgram/ml) was higher than normal, while those of chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid were extremely low or undetectable. Administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg per day, orally) for 2 weeks resulted in a marked reduction of serum cholic acid concentration. However, serum cholestanol levels remained unchanged.

	[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: long-term treatment with chenodesoxycholic acid (author's transl)].
	A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without hyperlipidaemia but with tendinous scanthomatosis, subtle neurological disorders and endocrine cataract is reported. Accumulation of cholestanol, a cholesterol derivative, was detected by mass fragmentography. The plasma cholestanol : cholesterol ratio was 30 times higher than normally. Treatment with chenodesoxycholic acid during 26 months brought about neurological improvement, stabilization of the cataract and xanthomatosis and return to normal of plasma cholestanol levels.

	Serum bile acid profiles in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Non-sulfated bile acid concentrations in sera of 10 cases of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were determined by mass fragmentography. Total bile acid (TBA) in serum was 0.492 +/- 0.436 microgram/ml (mean +/- SD) which was significantly lower than that (1.481 +/- 0.571) in healthy control sera. Cholic acid was 0.342 +/- 0.291 microgram/ml and was the dominant bile acid, which constituted 69.5% of TBA in serum. Chenodeoxycholic acid was 0.111 +/- 0.133 microgram/ml being a minor component in CTX sera, although it was the major bile acid in healthy control sera. Other bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid were scarcely detected. Subnormal TBA level and deranged bile acid composition in CTX sera may reflect the defect of bile acid biosynthesis in CTX patients. Determination of serum bile acid may be useful in the diagnosis of CTX.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a defect in cellular sterol biosynthetic control.
	A mentally retarded woman with tendon xanthomata and normal serum cholesterol concentration was found to have raised cholestanol concentrations in the serum and in a xanthoma. This confirmed the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CBX). No specific lipoprotein fraction was found to transport cholestanol. For the first time cultured fibroblasts from a patient with CBX were found to accumulate cholestanol.

	Abnormal high density lipoproteins in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The plasma lipoprotein profiles and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were characterized in patients with the genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Abnormalities in the HDL may contribute to their increased atherogenesis and excessive deposits of tissue sterols in the presence of low or low-normal concentrations of plasma cholesterol (165 +/- 25 mg/dl) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). The mean HDL-cholesterol concentration in the CTX plasmas was 14.5 +/- 3.2 mg/dl, about one-third the normal value. The low HDL-cholesterol reflects a low concentration and an abnormal lipid composition of the plasma HDL. Relative to normal HDL, the cholesteryl esters are low, free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal, and triglycerides increased. The ratio of apoprotein (apo) to total cholesterol in the HDL of CTX was two to three times greater than normal. In the CTX HDL, the ratio of apoAI to apoAII was high, the proportion of apoC low, and a normally minor form of apoAI increased relative to other forms. The HDL in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and in particle size. The abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and composition of the plasma HDL result from metabolic defects that are not understood but may be linked to the genetic defect in bile acid synthesis in CTX. As a consequence, it is probable that the normal functions of the HDL, possibly including modulation of LDL-cholesterol uptake and the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues, are perturbed significantly in this disease.

	Computed tomography in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In nine patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse white matter hypodensity above and below the tentorium. This was attributed to sterol infiltration with secondary demyelination. In one patient, a focal right cerebellar hypodense lesion reflected a true xanthoma.

7258222
	A unique patient with coexisting cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and beta-sitosterolemia.
	An adult Chinese man presented with tendinous and tuberous xanthomatosis and severe atheromatous changes in the coronary arteries. In addition, he had chronic hemolytic anemia, with spherostomatocytic erythrocytes. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was diagnosed on the basis of increased cholestanol levels in his plasma, red cells and xanthoma, changes in bile acid composition due to the defective synthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid. Coexisting beta-sitosterolemia was confirmed by the finding of large amounts of the plant sterols such as beta-sitosterol and campesterol. This is the first report of these two rare lipid storage disorders in the same patient.

	Genetics of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): an autosomal recessive trait with high gene frequency in Sephardim of Moroccan origin.
	We described 6 patients (from 3 families) affected with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). All are Sephardic Jews of Moroccan extraction. In view of the small number of CTX patients diagnosed in the world (a total of 50 including our 6 patients), we are probably dealing with an ethnic subgroup with a high CTX gene frequency, which we have estimated to be 1/108. Since there are differences in expression in this disease, we recommend cholestanol study in cases of undiagnosed cataract or tendinous xanthomas in childhood or early adolescence. The diagnosis in CTX is important not only for genetic counseling, but also in veiw of possible treatment.

	Occurrence of bile alcohol glucuronides in bile of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Using thin-layer chromatography, bile alcohol glucuronides were found with taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids in the bile of four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The concentration of the bile alcohol glucuronides was 1.7-5.2 times higher than that of the conjugated bile acids. Detectable amounts of unconjugated bile alcohols were not found in the bile of these patients. The bile alcohol glucuronides were isolated from the bile of one of the patients by means of preparative thin-layer chromatography. Treatment with beta-glucuronidase of the bile alcohol glucuronides liberated glucuronic acid and a mixture of bile alcohols. More than 90% of the liberated bile alcohols was 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 25-tetrol, and lesser amounts of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol, and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,-7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 alpha, 25-pentol were also obtained. The bile alcohol glucuronides were not oxidized by the treatment with 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, indicating that the glucuronide moiety was at 3 alpha-hydroxyl position of the bile alcohols. Comparison of the mass spectra of the acetylated and methylated derivatives of the natural glucuronides and the synthetic 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-triacetoxy-5 beta-cholestan-3 alpha-O-(methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronate) also indicated that the bile alcohol glucuronides consisted of mainly 5 beta - cholestane - 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25 - tetrol - glucuronide.

	Peripheral neuropathy in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	Four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) underwent electrophysiologic investigations, which demonstrated impairment in the functioning of the peripheral nerves in all four cases. The changes consisted of slow motor and sensory conduction. The changes were most marked in the older subjects, in whom the disease was more advanced, and who also had clinical manifestations of mild peripheral neuropathy.

	Configurational assignment of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol excreted by patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (a circular dichroism study).
	The absolute configuration of the C27 pentahydroxy bile alcohol present in bile and feces of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Under anhydrous conditions CD spectra of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol in the presence of Eu (fod) 3[tris (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3-hepta fluoro-7, 7-dimethyl-octane-4, 6-dionato) europium (III)] exhibited a large induced split Cotton effect at ca. 310 nm.

	Identifications of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23 beta-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 alpha-tetrol, and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 beta-tetrol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The bile alcohols present in the feces of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis were studied. Three bile alcohols which are different from any known natural bile alcohol were isolated as minor components of the fecal bile alcohol fraction. The structures of these compounds were established as 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23 beta-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 alpha-tetrol, and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 beta-tetrol by comparison with synthetic samples.

	Absolute configuration of pentahydroxy bile alcohols excreted by patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a circular dichroism study.
	The absolute configurations of the C27 pentahydroxy bile alcohols present in bile and feces of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectra of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24alpha,25-pentol in the presence of Eu(fod)3 [tris(1,1,1,2,2,3,3-heptafluoro-7,7-dimethyloctane-4,6-dionato) europium (III)] exhibited a negative Cotton effect and was assigned to 24R absolute configuration. Conversely, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24beta,25-pentol showed a strong positive Cotton effect and was assigned the 24S configuration. These assignments were based upon comparison with a model compound, 5-cholestene-3beta,24(R),25-triol, whose single-crystal X-ray structure has been determined. The importance of these data is to establish a structural mechanism for the conversion of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24S,25-pentol rather than 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24R,25-pentol into cholic acid in man as well as in animals.

	Evidence for the early reduction of the 24,25 double bond in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The metabolism of lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (DL) was examined in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis after intravenous pulse labeling with a mixture of DL-2-14C and 3S,4S,3R,4R-(4-3H)mevalonate. Sterols were isolated from the feces and purified by silver nitrate thin-layer chromatography, and their identities were confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Their specific activities were then determined and plotted as a function of time. These isotope ratio measurements and specific activity decay curves were consistent with 24,25-dihydrolanosterol and delta7-cholestenol being intermediates in the synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate and lanosterol, and they suggested that reduction of the lanosterol side chain may occur as an early step in the synthesis of cholesterol. These results are in contrast to the results reported after the administration of triparanol, a delta24-reductase inhibitor.

	The ultrastructure of lens and iris in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The lens and an iris biopsy from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis has been examined in the electron microscope. Subepithelial electron-lucent areas were demonstrated. The iris was normal. The lens changes were thought to be due to deposition of the specific cholesterol breakdown product inherent to this disease.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	A case of presumed cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is described. The association of cataracts with central nervous system signs and tendon xanthoma is noted. Deposition of cholestanol appears to be the primary lesion in this disease.

	Identification of pentahydroxy bile alcohols in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: characterization of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 24xi, 25-pentol and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 23xi, 25-pentol.
	This paper describes studies dealing with the nature of the C27 pentahydroxy bile alcohols present in the bile and feces of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The presence of a bile alcohol having the structure 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24alpha,25-pentol was confirmed by separation of the two 24-hydroxy epimers of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24,25-pentol and characterization of the dpimers by gas-liquid chromatography and infrared and mass spectrometry. Tentative assignment of the 24alpha and 24beta configuration was made on the basis of molecular rotation differences. A second major bile alcohol excreted by the CTX subjects was 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,23xi,25-pentol. Its structure was determined by infrared spectrometry, proton magnetic resonance spectrometry, and mass spectrometry because a reference compound was not available.

	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (cholestanolosis). Investigations on two sisters and their family.
	Two sisters, aged 38 and 32, suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are described. The most important clinical findings were xanthomas, central nervous affection with motor and mental dysfunction, EEG changes and juvenile cataract. The diagnosis was established by the demonstration of increased amounts of cholestanol in serum. Both sisters had amenorrhea, and their excretion of dehydroepiandrosterone in the urine was increased. In the elder sister, the levels of urinary 17-keto steroids, androsterone and estradiol were also increased. Other unusual features of the disease in the elder sister were hyper-prebeta-lipoproteinemia and serum cholesterol in the higher normal range.

	Familial cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Report of a new family and review of the literature.
	Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis occurred in a new family. This is a rare familial disorder characterized by juvenile cataracts, enlargement of tendons, low intelligence, and a variable neurological syndrome with cerebellar ataxia as the most prominent feature. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The basic defect remains obscure, but recent investigations have shown an excess of cholestanol in the tissues and serum of affected persons, which forms the basis of diagnosis.

	Transformation of 5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol to cholesterol and cholestanol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The metabolism of Delta(7)-cholestenol, cholesterol, and cholestanol was examined in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis after intravenous pulse-labeling with a mixture of dl-[2-(14)C]mevalonate and stereospecific 3S,4S,3R,4R-[4-(3)H]mevalonate. Silver nitrate and reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography were used to purify the sterols isolated from the feces, and their identities were confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The specific activities were determined and plotted as a function of time. Isotope ratio measurements and specific activity decay curves showed that sterol synthesis proceeded in the following sequence: mevalonate, squalene, lanosterol, Delta(7)-cholestenol, cholesterol, cholestanol. Labeled cholesterol precursors might be advantageously used to measure changes in cholesterol synthesis because they appear to equilibrate rapidly and have very short turnover times.

	A biochemical abnormality in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Impairment of bile acid biosynthesis associated with incomplete degradation of the cholesterol side chain.
	To explain this discrepancy, bile acid precursors were sought in bile and feces of three CTX subjects. Over 10% of the total sterols excreted in bile and feces consisted of compounds more polar than cholesterol. Chromatographic analysis of the polar fractions in conjunction with gasliquid chromatography (GLC)-mass spectrometry indicated two major constituents, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24xi,25-pentol. After i.v. injection of [4-(14)C]cholesterol both bile alcohols were radioactive proving that they were derived from cholesterol. The accumulation of alcohols hydroxylated at C-25 and C-24,25 suggests that decreased bile acid synthesis in CTX results from impaired oxidation of the cholesterol side chain.

	The metabolism of cholestanol, cholesterol, and bile acids in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	The metabolism of cholesterol and its 5-dihydro derivative, cholestanol, was investigated by means of sterol balance and isotope kinetic techniques in 3 subjects with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and 11 other individuals. All subjects were hospitalized on a metabolic ward and were fed diets practically free of cholesterol and cholestanol. After the intravenous administration of [1,2-(3)H]cholestanol, the radioactive sterol was transported and esterified in plasma lipoproteins in an identical manner to cholesterol. In these short-term experiments, the specific activity-time curves of plasma cholestanol conformed to two-pool models in both the CTX and control groups. However, cholestanol plasma concentrations, total body miscible pools, and daily synthesis rates were two to five times greater in the CTX than control individuals. The short-term specific activity decay curves of plasma [4-(14)C]cholesterol also conformed to two-pool models in both groups.

	Biosynthesis of 5 -cholestan-3 -ol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
	In two patients with the disease, the biosynthesis of cholestanol was examined by different techniques. After cholesterol-4-(14)C was injected intravenously into one patient, cholestanol and cholesterol isolated from the bile on 3 different days over the ensuing week contained significant radioactivity. The specific radioactivity-time curves for cholesterol-(14)C and cholestanol-(14)C suggested a precursor product relationship and provided additional evidence for the transformation of cholesterol into cholestanol. The second patient received intravenously a mixture of mevalonate-2-(14)C and stereospecifically labeled mevalonate-3R,4R-(3)H. Again cholesterol and cholestanol were isolated from the bile, and the (3)H/(14)C ratio in both sterols was almost the same. This experiment again demonstrated that the biosynthetic path of cholestanol proceeded through cholesterol and not directly from earlier 5alpha-H-saturated precursors. These two independent lines of evidence indicate that the extraordinary deposition of cholestanol in Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis arises from cholesterol presumably through the accentuation of the normal biosynthetic pathway.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare neurological
      disease characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in brain and
      tendons caused by a mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A1). The
      mechanism behind the accumulation of cholestanol in the brain was recently
      clarified and a role of 27-hydroxycholesterol as a regulator of brain cholesterol
      homeostasis has been established. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a significant flux of
      the bile acid precursor 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one across the blood-brain
      barrier in cy27-/- mice with its subsequent conversion into cholestanol. CTX
      patients with white matter lesions and vacuolation are described. CYP27A1 was
      identified as a candidate gene for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
      SUMMARY: The mechanism behind accumulation of cholestanol in brain and tendons of
      patients with CTX has been clarified but it is not known why this accumulation is
      associated with parallel accumulation of cholesterol and formation of xanthomas. 
      Further studies are needed to understand why some patients with CTX develop white
      matter lesions in the brain. In view of the fact that CTX can present with upper 
      motor neuronal signs it is interesting that CYP27 has been shown to be a
      candidate gene for sporadic ALS.

PG  - 171-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare and treatable autosomal recessive 
      disease. The diagnosis should be suspected in the presence of a suggestive
      clinical triad characterized by early-onset cataract, tendinous xanthomata and
      neurological symptoms and signs, notably cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation
      and pyramidal syndrome.The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating an increased
      blood level of cholestanol, or/and by molecular genetic analysis.In typical
      cases, brain MRI shows bilateral hyperintensity of the cerebellar nucleus
      dentatus together with cerebral atrophy and leukoencephalopathy. The treatment is
      based on the administration of chenodeoxycholic acid. The aim is to restore the
      negative feedback on the enzymatic cascade altered by mutation in the gene CYP27 
      which induces a 27-hydroxylase deficiency

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), also known as Van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein
      disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the lipid metabolism.
      To date, there are less than 300 cases reported worldwide. We present a case of a
      30 year old male who presented with mental retardation and swelling of ankles,
      with the a spectrum of CTX imaging findings. Imaging studies were performed which
      included plain X-ray, Ultrasound(US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of both 
      the brain and ankles. These pointed towards the diagnosis of CTX with the entire 
      spectrum of findings which was confirmed with biopsy and laboratory findings. CTX
      is a potentially treatable condition with replacement therapy, and hence early
      diagnosis before neurological deterioration is important. This is aided by the
      imaging findings which are conclusive forte diagnosis of CTX.

TI  - The neuropsychiatry of inborn errors of metabolism.
AB  - A number of metabolic disorders that affect the central nervous system can
      present in childhood, adolescence or adulthood as a phenocopy of a major
      psychiatric syndrome such as psychosis, depression, anxiety or mania. An
      understanding and awareness of secondary syndromes in metabolic disorders is of
      great importance as it can lead to the early diagnosis of such disorders. Many of
      these metabolic disorders are progressive and may have illness-modifying
      treatments available. Earlier diagnosis may prevent or delay damage to the
      central nervous system and allow for the institution of appropriate treatment and
      family and genetic counselling. Metabolic disorders appear to result in
      neuropsychiatric illness either through disruption of late neurodevelopmental
      processes (metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, GM2
      gangliosidosis, Niemann-Pick type C, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, neuronal
      ceroid lipofuscinosis, and alpha mannosidosis) or via chronic or acute disruption
      of excitatory/inhibitory or monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems (acute
      intermittent porphyria, maple syrup urine disease, urea cycle disorders,
      phenylketonuria and disorders of homocysteine metabolism). In this manuscript we 
      review the evidence for neuropsychiatric illness in major metabolic disorders and
      discuss the possible models for how these disorders result in psychiatric
      symptoms. Treatment considerations are discussed, including treatment resistance,
      the increased propensity for side-effects and the possibility of some treatments 
      worsening the underlying disorder.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage
      disorder affecting the biosynthetic pathway of bile acids, leading to increased
      cholestanol formation and its accumulation in various tissues. Patients can
      present with tendon xanthomas, gait abnormalities, osteoporosis with or without a
      pathological fracture, diminished vision, intractable diarrhoea, seizures,
      ataxia, psychosis, and mental retardation. We report a 20-year-old man who
      presented with multiple recurrent tendon swellings and seizures. The earlier
      diagnosis and treatment helps in preventing the devastating neurological sequalae
      of this sinister condition. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid is crucial in
      preventing the progression of this rare disorder.

PG  - 78-83
LID - 10.1097/WNF.0b013e318288076a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the long-term neurological outcome of Jewish Israeli
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) after several years of
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) treatment. METHODS: A cross sectional observational 
      study of all patients with a diagnosis of CTX followed in a referral outpatient
      clinic during the years 2003-2012. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (10 men) from 11
      families were enrolled. Sixteen patients were included in the analysis (2
      patients had low compliance for treatment). The mean +/- SD age at last
      evaluation was 35.0 +/- 9.2 years (range, 16-45 years). After their diagnosis, at
      age 22.6 +/- 10.8 years, all patients were treated with CDCA. Patients who
      started treatment after the age of 25 years had worse outcome and were
      significantly more limited in ambulation (P = 0.004) and more cognitively
      impaired (P = 0.047). Five patients who started treatment after 25 years of age
      continued to deteriorate despite CDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Beginning CDCA
      treatment as early as possible is crucial to preventing neurological damage and
      deterioration in CTX. After significant neurological pathology is established,
      the effect of treatment is limited and deterioration may continue.

AB  - Inborn errors of metabolism may impact on muscle and peripheral nerve.
      Abnormalities involve mitochondria and other subcellular organelles such as
      peroxisomes and lysosomes related to the turnover and recycling of cellular
      compartments. Treatable causes are beta-oxidation defects producing progressive
      neuropathy; pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, porphyria, or vitamin B12
      deficiency causing recurrent episodes of neuropathy or acute motor deficit
      mimicking Guillain-Barre syndrome. On the other hand, lysosomal
      (mucopolysaccharidosis, Gaucher and Fabry diseases), mitochondriopathic
      (mitochondrial or nuclear mutations or mDNA depletion), peroxisomal
      (adrenomyeloneuropathy, Refsum disease, sterol carrier protein-2 deficiency,
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, alpha-methylacyl racemase deficiency) diseases
      are multisystemic disorders involving also the heart, liver, brain, retina, and
      kidney. Pathophysiology of most metabolic myopathies is related to the impairment
      of energy production or to abnormal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
      Main symptoms are excercise intolerance with myalgias, cramps and recurrent
      myoglobinuria or limb weakness associated with elevation of serum creatine
      kinase. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency, followed by acid maltase
      deficiency, and lipin deficiency, are the most common cause of isolated
      rhabdomyolysis. Metabolic myopathies are frequently associated to
      extra-neuromuscular disorders particularly involving the heart, liver, brain,
      retina, skin, and kidney.

TI  - Hereditary ataxias: overview.
LID - 10.1038/gim.2013.28 [doi]
AB  - The hereditary ataxias are a highly heterogeneous group of disorders
      phenotypically characterized by gait ataxia, incoordination of eye movements,
      speech, and hand movements, and usually associated with atrophy of the
      cerebellum. There are more than 35 autosomal dominant types frequently termed
      spinocerebellar ataxia and typically having adult onset. The most common subtypes
      are spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, all of which are nucleotide repeat 
      expansion disorders. Autosomal recessive ataxias usually have onset in childhood;
      the most common subtypes are -Friedreich, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with
      oculomotor apraxia type 1, and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2. Four
      autosomal recessive types have dietary or biochemical treatment modalities
      (ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Refsum, and
      coenzyme Q10 deficiency), whereas there are no specific treatments for other
      ataxias. Diagnostic genetic testing is complicated because of the large number of
      relatively uncommon subtypes with extensive phenotypic overlap. However, the best
      testing strategy is based on assessing relative frequencies, ethnic
      predilections, and recognition of associated phenotypic features such as
      seizures, visual loss, or associated movement abnormalities.Genet Med advance

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with bilateral achilles tendon
      xanthomata: a case report.
PG  - 152-5
AB  - Xanthomas are described as deposits in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Mostly 
      known as pseudotumors, xanthomas consist of connective tissue containing mainly
      cholesterol, triglycerides, and numerous foamy macrophages. Bilateral Achilles
      tendon xanthomata is pathognomonic for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in the case
      of normal cholesterol levels but increased cholestanol levels in serum. In this
      article, we present findings regarding bilateral xanthomas of Achilles tendons in
      a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

AB  - Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are caused by mutations in genes coding for
      enzymes and other proteins involved in cell metabolism. Many IEM can be treated
      effectively. Although IEM have usually been considered pediatric diseases, they
      can present at any age, mostly with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, and
      therefore constitute an integral subspeciality of neurology. However, although
      they are increasingly being recognized, IEM remain rare, and the care for
      patients should be optimized in specialized reference centers. Since the number
      of different diseases is very large, the diagnostic approach needs to be
      rigorous, starting at the clinics and calling upon the additional help of
      neuroradiology, biochemistry and molecular biology. In practice, it is important 
      for the neurologist to recognize: (1) when to start suspecting an IEM; and (2)
      how to correlate a given clinical presentation with one of the five major groups 
      of diseases affecting the nervous system. These five groups may be classified as:
      (a) energy metabolism disorders such as respiratory chain disorders, pyruvate
      dehydrogenase deficiency, GLUT1 deficiency, fatty-acid beta-oxidation defects,
      and disorders involving key cofactors such as electron transfer flavoprotein,
      thiamine, biotin, riboflavin, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10; (b) intoxication
      syndromes such as porphyrias, urea-cycle defects, homocystinurias, organic
      acidurias and amino acidopathies; (c) lipid-storage disorders such as lysosomal
      storage disorders (Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Niemann - Pick
      disease type C, Fabry disease and Gaucher's disease), peroxisomal disorders
      (adrenomyeloneuropathy, Refsum disease, disorders of pristanic acid metabolism,
      peroxisome biogenesis disorders), Tangier disease and cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis; (d) metal-storage diseases such as iron, copper and manganese
      metabolic disorders; and (e) neurotransmitter metabolism defects, including
      defects of serotonin, dopamine and glycine metabolism.

AB  - We report a 25-year-old young man presenting with cognitive decline,
      pancerebellar features, spastic quadriparesis, bilateral cataract (operated) and 
      tendo-Achilles swelling (xanthoma). The CT of the head showed bilateral
      cerebellar hypodensities. There were bilateral cerebellar hypointensities
      involving dentate nuclei on T1-weighted images with corresponding
      hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI. Additionally, an interesting MRI
      finding-'hot cross bun' appearance was seen in pons which has not been reported
      in the literature so far. Biopsy from tendo-Achilles confirmed xanthoma. He was
      treated with chenodeoxycholic acid following which he showed improvement in
      cognition and weakness.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a progressive neurodegenerative
      storage disease caused by recessive CYP27A1 mutations and is characterized by
      abnormal deposition of cholestanol and cholesterol in multiple tissues, including
      the lens and brain. Oral chenodeoxycholic acid is preventive and can be
      therapeutic, but is not used optimally because the condition typically is
      diagnosed late or not at all. When affected children demonstrate lens opacities, 
      ophthalmologists have the unique potential to facilitate earlier diagnosis and
      treatment by recognizing the juvenile cataract phenotype. This study highlights
      the morphology of lens opacities in a family with genetically confirmed disease. 
      DESIGN: Prospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four siblings and their 2 parents,
      who are first cousins. METHODS: Ophthalmic examination, general physical
      examination, and exome sequencing guided by homozygosity analysis. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Ophthalmic findings, general clinical findings, and results of CYP27A1 
      candidate gene testing. RESULTS: Two sisters, each visually symptomatic before 10
      years of age, had a unique pattern of bilateral fleck deposits throughout the
      lens with significant posterior capsular cataract. When initially examined at 8
      years of age, their then-asymptomatic younger brother had the same bilateral
      fleck deposits with minimal posterior capsular opacity; 1 year later, he
      demonstrated anterior capsular opacity and became symptomatic. Both asymptomatic 
      parents had few but distinct similar flecks localized at or near the anterior
      Y-suture, whereas an asymptomatic sister did not. Genetic analysis revealed
      homozygosity for a known CYP27A1 mutation (c.1263+1G --> A) in the 3 symptomatic 
      siblings, heterozygosity for the mutation in the 2 parents, and no mutation in
      the asymptomatic sister. When specifically questioned, the 3 affected children
      had experienced recurrent bouts of diarrhea in early childhood, which is a common
      feature of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: An unusual pattern of fleck lenticular
      deposits was seen in affected children. With time, capsular opacities (posterior 
      only or posterior and anterior) developed and caused visual symptoms. Such
      juvenile lenticular findings should raise suspicion for this treatable metabolic 
      disorder, especially when in the context of recurrent diarrhea during early
      childhood. Asymptomatic fleck-like opacities at or near the anterior Y-suture may
      be a carrier sign. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, but treatable lipid storage
      disorder caused by mutation in the CYP27A1 gene. The disorder results in
      deposition of cholestanol in various tissues. The classical CTX phenotype
      includes diarrhoea, juvenile cataract, xanthoma and progressive neurological
      symptoms. Studies have shown that progression of symptoms can be halted or even
      reversed, if treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid is initiated early. The
      diagnosis of CTX is often delayed due to lack of awareness of the disease. We
      describe the history, clinical features, biochemical, genetic and magnetic
      resonance imaging findings of the first reported case of CTX in Denmark.

TI  - Long-term bone density evaluation in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: evidence of 
      improvement after chenodeoxycholic acid treatment.
PG  - 282-6
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9677-3 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is known to be associated with osteoporosis 
      and a higher incidence of bone fractures. However, the underlying pathogenesis is
      still unknown, and the effects of long-term replacement therapy with
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on bone mineral density (BMD) have not been fully
      investigated. We studied 11 CTX patients aged 13-43 years. We performed
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and assessed serum cholestanol and
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations both at the time of diagnosis and
      after long-term treatment with CDCA. At baseline, we found low BMD in nine
      patients, cholestanol elevation in all subjects, and 25-OHD decrease in nine.
      After a mean follow-up time of 30 months (range 24-36), no substantial clinical
      changes including bone fractures occurred; and we detected a significant increase
      of both planar and volumetric BMD as well as normalization of plasma cholestanol 
      levels and increase of serum 25-OHD. Densitometric improvement following CDCA
      introduction was not correlated to changes of biochemical parameters. Our study
      confirms the presence of low bone mass in CTX and demonstrates that long-term
      CDCA treatment increases bone mineral content. In this respect, improvement of
      vitamin D intestinal absorption secondary to bile acid restoration could play an 
      important role. Moreover, our data strongly suggest the utility of periodic bone 
      density evaluation in CTX patients.

TI  - Atypical parkinsonism and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: report of a family with
      corticobasal syndrome and a literature review.
PG  - 1769-74
LID - 10.1002/mds.25229 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an autosomal recessive inborn error of
      cholesterol metabolism. It presents with systemic and neurological symptoms,
      rarely including parkinsonism. Presented here are a clinical description of a new
      family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and parkinsonism and a review of 13
      additional cases reported in the literature. The index case developed
      corticobasal syndrome, previously not reported in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
      His brother had parkinsonism with cerebellar features and cognitive impairment.
      In a literature review, median age of onset of parkinsonism was found to be 40
      years. Nearly all patients had other neurological symptoms: cognitive (93%),
      pyramidal (93%), or cerebellar (53%). All patients had walking difficulties, with
      falls in 27%. Systemic features were common: cataracts (93%) or tendon xanthomata
      (87%). Frequent MRI abnormalities included cerebellar atrophy (100%), cerebral
      atrophy (80%), and dentate nuclei signal changes (80%). Functional dopaminergic
      imaging often demonstrated presynaptic denervation. Improvement with levodopa was
      frequent (91%) but mild. Progressive neurological decline occurred in 92% of
      patients despite treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical
      parkinsonism, including corticobasal syndrome, particularly with early age of
      onset and in the context of a complex neurological phenotype. Tendon xanthomata, 
      early-onset cataracts, and radiological findings of cerebellar atrophy with
      lesions of the dentate nuclei are useful clinical clues. Symptomatic treatment
      with levodopa may help, but progressive neurological decline is frequent despite 
      treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.

TI  - Myoclonus and dystonia in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1805-10
LID - 10.1002/mds.25206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an inherited neurometabolic
      disorder. The main neurological manifestations of the disease are pyramidal
      syndrome, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and
      psychiatric disturbances. Myoclonic dystonia has been reported on in the setting 
      of various neurometabolic diseases. Anecdotal reports describe movement disorders
      associated with CTX, but no dystonia with myoclonic events. METHODS: We collected
      clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological, neuroradiological, and genetic data 
      of 6 patients with myoclonus and mild dystonia associated with CTX. From a
      systematic literature review, we analyzed 31 patients with movement disorders
      secondary to CTX. RESULTS: Our 6 patients presented distal myoclonus with mild
      dystonia of the upper limbs. Myoclonus was of subcortical origin, based on
      neurophysiological recordings, and differed from oromandibular myoclonus
      previously described in CTX patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results expand the
      phenotype of CTX and suggest that myoclonus and/or dystonia are underdiagnosed.
      In keeping with our findings, tremors previously observed in CTX patients might
      actually correspond to myoclonic events. We hypothesize that a dysfunction of the
      dentate nuclei-basal ganglia pathway may be involved.

AB  - I have been involved in research on oxysterols since 1963 and this review is
      intended to cover some of the most important aspects of this work. The first
      project dealed with 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. My successful synthesis of 
      this steroid with high specific radioactivity allowed a demonstration that it is 
      a bile acid precursor. The mechanism of conversion of 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol
      into 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was investigated and I concluded that only 
      one enzyme is required and that no isomerase is involved. Accumulation of
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in patients with lack of sterol 27-hydroxylase
      (Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was shown to be an important pathogenetic factor.
      This disease is characterized by cholestanol-containing xanthomas in tendons and 
      brain and we could show that most of this cholestanol is formed from
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. We also showed that
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one passes the blood-brain barrier. In contrast to
      cholesterol itself, side-chain oxidized oxysterols have a high capacity to pass
      lipophilic membranes. We demonstrated conversion of cholesterol into
      27-hydroxycholesterol to be a significant mechanism for elimination of
      cholesterol from macrophages. We also showed that conversion of cholesterol into 
      24S-hydroxycholesterol is important for elimination of cholesterol from the
      brain. Side-chain oxidized oxysterols have a high capacity to affect critical
      genes in cholesterol turnover in vitro. Most of the published in vitro
      experiments with oxysteroids are highly unphysiological, however. Mouse models
      studied in my laboratory with high or low levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol have
      little or no disturbances in cholesterol homeostasis. 24S-hydroxycholesterol is
      an efficient ligand to LXR and suggested to be important for cholesterol
      homeostasis in the brain. We recently developed a mouse model with markedly
      increased levels of this oxysterol in circulation and brain. This overexpression 
      had however only a very modest effect on cholesterol turnover. We concluded that 
      oxysterols are not the master regulators of cholesterol homeostasis in vivo
      suggested previously.

TI  - Summarizing phenotype evolution patterns from report cases.
PG  - S25-36
LID - 10.1007/s10916-012-9887-2 [doi]
AB  - The need to represent and manage time is implicit in several reasoning processes 
      in medicine. However, this is predominantly obvious in the field of many
      neurodegenerative disorders, which are characterized by insidious onsets,
      progressive courses and variable combinations of clinical manifestations in each 
      patient. Therefore, the availability of tools providing high level descriptions
      of the evolution of phenotype manifestations from patient data is crucial to
      promote early disease recognition and optimize the diagnostic process. Although
      many case reports published in the literature do not provide exhaustive temporal 
      information except only key time references, such as disease onset, diagnosis or 
      monitoring time, automatically comparing cases described by temporal clinical
      manifestation sequences can provide valuable knowledge about the data evolution. 
      In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of representing patient case reports
      of a neurodegenerative disorder as a set of temporal clinical manifestations
      semantically annotated with a domain phenotype ontology and registered with a
      time-stamped value. Novel techniques are presented to query and match sets of
      different manifestation sequences from multiple patient cases, with the aim of
      automatically inferring phenotype evolution patterns of generic patients for
      clinical studies. The method was applied to 25 patient report cases from a
      Spanish study of the domain of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Five evolution
      patterns were automatically generated to analyze the patient data. The results
      were evaluated against 49 relevant conclusions drawn from the study, with a
      precision of 93 % and a recall of 70 %.

AB  - A young man was brought for mental retardation, frequent non-bloody diarrhoea and
      swellings at ankles and elbow. He became bed-ridden due to cataract, mental
      retardation and pain in the back and lower limb. There were repeated pathological
      fractures and vitamin D deficiency without renal dysfunction. There were low
      low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. MRI of the brain revealed
      hypointense lesions in cerebellar white matter, heterogenous hyperintensity in
      dentate nucleus and adjacent white matter, right basal ganglia and in the
      periventricular region with diffuse cerebral atrophy. T1-weighted MRI (ankle
      region) revealed bilaterally thickened and irregular achilles tendons with
      hyperintense masses surrounded by patchy hypointensities. A similar xanthomatous 
      lesion (cholestanol deposits) was also present in the sacral region. Vitamin D
      and calcium supplementation and chenodeoxycholic acid therapy improved pain at
      lower limbs and body weight. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare
      autosomal-recessive familial mutation of the sterol 27 hydroxylase causing lipid 
      metabolic disease.

TI  - Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous
      determination of oxysterols, plant sterols, and cholesterol precursors.
PG  - 1557-64
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2012.189605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesterol precursors and plant sterols have considerable potential 
      as plasma biomarkers in several disorders of sterol metabolism and intestinal
      sterol absorption. Oxysterols are associated with atherogenesis,
      neurodegeneration, and inflammation. We developed a GC-MS method for the
      simultaneous analysis of these species in human plasma, including 24-, 25-,
      27-hydroxycholesterol; 7-ketocholesterol; lanosterol; lathosterol;
      7-dehydrocholesterol; desmosterol; stigmasterol; sitosterol; and campesterol.
      METHODS: Sterols were hydrolyzed with ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution,
      extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with n-hexane, and derivatized with
      N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoracetamide. Positive chemical ionization with
      ammonia, as reagent gas, was applied to generate high abundant precursor ions.
      RESULTS: The definition of highly sensitive precursor/product ion transitions,
      especially for coeluting substances, allowed fast gas chromatography run times of
      under 8.5 min. Using the multiple reaction monitoring mode, detection limits in
      the picogram per milliliter range could be achieved for most compounds. The
      method was validated for precision and recovery. Intraassay and interassay CVs
      were mostly <15% for serum and plasma samples. The recoveries of supplemented
      plasma samples in different concentrations were 88%-117%. The method was applied 
      to stratification of patients with disorders in cholesterol biosynthesis and/or
      cholesterol absorption in hypercholesterolemia. The method revealed associations 
      of sterol species with thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This
      method allows high-throughput sterol profiling in various diseases.

      chenodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 268-74
LID - 10.1007/s00415-012-6630-3 [doi]
AB  - Polyneuropathy has been reported in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX),
      although its nature and possible association with certain genotypes and
      phenotypes are unclear. The effect of chronic administration of chenodeoxycholic 
      acid (CDCA) on peripheral nerve conduction parameters is still debated. We report
      clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiological findings in 35 CTX patients.
      Twenty-six subjects (74.2 %) showed peripheral nerve abnormalities.
      Polyneuropathy was predominantly axonal (76.9 % of patients) and generally mild. 
      No correlation was found between its presence and clinical or biochemical data.
      In polyneuropathic patients, CDCA treatment improved electrophysiological
      conduction parameters, irrespective of the duration of therapy. Improvement
      mainly concerned nerve conduction velocities, whereas most nerve amplitudes
      remained unchanged. This means that CDCA treatment did not influence the number
      of axons activated by maximum electrical stimulation but increased the conduction
      of the still-excitable fibers. Our findings may suggest that CDCA treatment
      promotes myelin synthesis in nerve fibers with residual unaffected axons. The
      effect of therapy may therefore depend largely on the extent of irreversible
      structural damage to axons.

TI  - Querying phenotype-genotype relationships on patient datasets using semantic web 
      technology: the example of Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Semantic Web technology can considerably catalyze translational
      genetics and genomics research in medicine, where the interchange of information 
      between basic research and clinical levels becomes crucial. This exchange
      involves mapping abstract phenotype descriptions from research resources, such as
      knowledge databases and catalogs, to unstructured datasets produced through
      experimental methods and clinical practice. This is especially true for the
      construction of mutation databases. This paper presents a way of harmonizing
      abstract phenotype descriptions with patient data from clinical practice, and
      querying this dataset about relationships between phenotypes and genetic
      variants, at different levels of abstraction. METHODS: Due to the current
      availability of ontological and terminological resources that have already
      reached some consensus in biomedicine, a reuse-based ontology engineering
      approach was followed. The proposed approach uses the Ontology Web Language (OWL)
      to represent the phenotype ontology and the patient model, the Semantic Web Rule 
      Language (SWRL) to bridge the gap between phenotype descriptions and clinical
      data, and the Semantic Query Web Rule Language (SQWRL) to query relevant
      phenotype-genotype bidirectional relationships. The work tests the use of
      semantic web technology in the biomedical research domain named cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis (CTX), using a real dataset and ontologies. RESULTS: A framework to
      query relevant phenotype-genotype bidirectional relationships is provided.
      Phenotype descriptions and patient data were harmonized by defining 28 Horn-like 
      rules in terms of the OWL concepts. In total, 24 patterns of SWQRL queries were
      designed following the initial list of competency questions. As the approach is
      based on OWL, the semantic of the framework adapts the standard logical model of 
      an open world assumption. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates how semantic web
      technologies can be used to support flexible representation and computational
      inference mechanisms required to query patient datasets at different levels of
      abstraction. The open world assumption is especially good for describing only
      partially known phenotype-genotype relationships, in a way that is easily
      extensible. In future, this type of approach could offer researchers a valuable
      resource to infer new data from patient data for statistical analysis in
      translational research. In conclusion, phenotype description formalization and
      mapping to clinical data are two key elements for interchanging knowledge between
      basic and clinical research.

AB  - Bile acids, bile alcohols, and hormonal steroids represent the ultimate
      biologically active products of cholesterol metabolism in vertebrates. However,
      intermediates in their formation, including oxysterols and cholestenoic acids,
      also possess known, e.g., as ligands to nuclear and G-protein-coupled receptors, 
      and unknown regulatory activities. The potential diversity of molecules
      originating from the cholesterol structure is very broad and their abundance in
      biological materials ranges over several orders of magnitude. Here we describe
      the application of enzyme-assisted derivatization for sterol analysis (EADSA) in 
      combination with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry 
      to define the oxysterol and cholestenoic acid metabolomes of human plasma.
      Quantitative profiling of adult plasma using EADSA leads to the detection of over
      30 metabolites derived from cholesterol, some of which are ligands to the nuclear
      receptors LXR, FXR, and pregnane X receptor or the G-protein-coupled receptor
      Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2. The potential of the EADSA technique in
      screening for inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis is
      demonstrated by the unique plasma profile of patients suffering from
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The analytical methods described are easily
      adapted to the analysis of other biological fluids, including cerebrospinal
      fluid, and also tissues, e.g., brain, in which nuclear and G-protein-coupled
      receptors may have important regulatory roles.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder,
      which usually presents with diverse systemic manifestations (ophthalmologic,
      cardiac, and dermatologic symptoms), and neurological dysfunction, such as
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline, and ataxia. Epilepsy is rarely seen
      as the main neurological manifestation of CTX. Herein, we describe a middle-aged 
      woman with epilepsy since childhood as the only neurological symptom associated
      with the classical systemic manifestations of CTX.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare inherited neurometabolic disease. 
      Clinical symptoms are caused by increased deposition of cholestanol and
      cholesterol in various tissues. Progressive neurological symptoms are one of the 
      principal manifestations. We report the case of a 44-year-old man who presented
      with asymmetric parkinsonism. In addition, there were mild bilateral pyramidal
      signs and a mild polyneuropathy. Brain MRI showed bilateral lesions in the
      dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and in the substantia nigra. Nuclear brain
      imaging using I-123-FP-CIT demonstrated an asymmetric reduced presynaptic
      dopaminergic function of the putamen and caudate nucleus, correlating well with
      his lateralized bradykinetic-rigid syndrome. CTX was diagnosed based on an
      increased plasma level of cholestanol, typical cerebellar brain lesions and the
      causative genetic mutation. CTX presenting with parkinsonism is considered rare
      and data on the neuroimaging of the dopaminergic deficit are limited.

      ALS.
PG  - e35333
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0035333 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease
      characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. ALS is considered to be a
      complex trait and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated a few
      susceptibility loci. However, many more causal loci remain to be discovered.
      Since it has been shown that genetic variants associated with complex traits are 
      more likely to be eQTLs than frequency-matched variants from GWAS platforms, we
      conducted a two-stage genome-wide screening for eQTLs associated with ALS. In
      addition, we applied an eQTL analysis to finemap association loci. Expression
      profiles using peripheral blood of 323 sporadic ALS patients and 413 controls
      were mapped to genome-wide genotyping data. Subsequently, data from a two-stage
      GWAS (3,568 patients and 10,163 controls) were used to prioritize eQTLs
      identified in the first stage (162 ALS, 207 controls). These prioritized eQTLs
      were carried forward to the second sample with both gene-expression and
      genotyping data (161 ALS, 206 controls). Replicated eQTL SNPs were then tested
      for association in the second-stage GWAS data to find SNPs associated with
      disease, that survived correction for multiple testing. We thus identified twelve
      cis eQTLs with nominally significant associations in the second-stage GWAS data. 
      Eight SNP-transcript pairs of highest significance (lowest p = 1.27 x 10(-51))
      withstood multiple-testing correction in the second stage and modulated CYP27A1
      gene expression. Additionally, we show that C9orf72 appears to be the only gene
      in the 9p21.2 locus that is regulated in cis, showing the potential of this
      approach in identifying causative genes in association loci in ALS. This study
      has identified candidate genes for sporadic ALS, most notably CYP27A1. Mutations 
      in CYP27A1 are causal to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis which can present as a
      clinical mimic of ALS with progressive upper motor neuron loss, making it a
      plausible susceptibility gene for ALS.

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i10.1067 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinical presentations associated with bile acid
      synthesis defects and to describe identification of individual disorders and
      diagnostic pitfalls. METHODS: Authors describe semiquantitative determination of 
      16 urinary bile acid metabolites by electrospray ionization-tandem mass
      spectrometry. Sample preparation was performed by solid-phase extraction. The
      total analysis time was 2 min per sample. Authors determined bile acid
      metabolites in 363 patients with suspected defects in bile acid metabolism.
      RESULTS: Abnormal bile acid metabolites were found in 36 patients. Two patients
      had bile acid synthesis defects but presented with atypical presentations. In 2
      other patients who were later shown to be affected by biliary atresia and cystic 
      fibrosis the profile of bile acid metabolites was initially suggestive of a bile 
      acid synthesis defect. Three adult patients suffered from cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis. Nineteen patients had peroxisomal disorders, and 10 patients had
      cholestatic hepatopathy of other cause. CONCLUSION: Screening for urinary
      cholanoids should be done in every infant with cholestatic hepatopathy as well as
      in children with progressive neurological disease to provide specific therapy.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare cause of spinocerebellar syndrome.
PG  - 600-3
AB  - A 34-year-old patient demonstrating pyramidal and cerebellar signs, accompanied
      by epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, mental retardation and bilateral cataract was
      diagnosed with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis based on the clinical picture,
      magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and serum sterol analysis. Tendon
      xanthomas were not observed in this case. After establishing the diagnosis,
      treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid and statin was introduced. During the next
      two years of the follow-up, serum cholestanol and 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol
      levels decreased in response to the therapy, but this was not reflected in the
      patient's neurological condition, which was slowly progressing. Treatment
      effectiveness in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is variable, notably better in
      patients who had started therapy before the injury to the nervous system took
      place. The present case report points to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as a rare
      cause of spinocerebellar syndrome, which might be treatable if diagnosed in early
      life.

PG  - 332-3

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a treatable disorder of bile acid
      production caused by mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxilase.
      This inborn error of bile acid metabolism results in lipid pathologic
      accumulation in multiple tissues. Progressive neuropsychiatric disturbances are a
      frequent manifestation of this disease. Although seizures have been frequently
      noticed as part of CTX manifestations, there have not been reports of CTX being
      diagnosed in drug-resistant epilepsy diagnostic workup nor of seizure response to
      chenodeoxycholic acid treatment. Here, the authors present a case of a
      drug-resistant epilepsy patient with a complex phenotype where a diagnosis of CTX
      was done and showed a significant reduction in seizure frequency after
      chenodeoxycholic acid supplementation. This report illustrates the importance of 
      considering treatable neurometabolic disorders in epileptic patients showing
      complex phenotypes.

AB  - The bile steroids (BS) cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are produced in
      hepatocytes and in the brain. Nothing is known about neuronal actions of BS.
      Deficiency in a 27-hydroxylase enzyme coincides with reduced production of
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and a relative increase in cholic acid in an
      inherited lipid storage disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, characterized by
      neurological dysfunctions, which can be treated by dietary CDCA. We have examined
      the modulation of hypothalamic network activity by nine common BS. Cholate and
      CDCA significantly reduced the firing of hypothalamic neurons and synchronized
      network activity with CDCA being nearly 10 times more potent. The synthetic BS
      dehydrocholate synchronized the activity without affecting the firing rate.
      Gabazine, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, occluded synchronization by BS.
      Whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed a block of NMDA- and GABA(A)-receptors
      by BS. Potencies of nine common BS differed between NMDA and GABA(A) receptors,
      however in both cases they correlated with BS affinities for albumin but not with
      their lipophilicity, supporting a direct action at ligand gated ion channels.
      GABAergic synaptic currents displayed a faster decay under BS. Our data provide
      new insight into extrahepatic functions of BS revealing their neuroactive
      potential.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare, autosomal-recessive, lipid-storage
      disease with accumulation of cholestanol in most tissues, particularly within the
      Achilles tendons. It has been characterized both clinically and biochemically,
      and recently from the molecular biological aspect as well. Juvenile cataract,
      childhood diarrhea, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia, and tendon xanthomas
      are the most prominent features of this disease. Bilateral symmetrical firm
      masses of Achilles tendons may be the first symptom the patient recognizes
      because it can jeopardize his or her ability to walk. However, the treatment
      strategies for tendon tumors vary. In a recent case, we diagnosed the disease
      properly, according to the clinical manifestations and the radiological and
      laboratory examinations. The genetic mutation was characterized by analyzing
      sterol 27-hydroxylase from the patient's family (located on nucleotide 599) and
      led to a nonsense mutation. It is a unique type of mutation that has never been
      reported to our knowledge. Tendon lesions are characterized by the loss of muscle
      fibers and accumulation of lipid products. To help the patient regain the
      strength of the Achilles tendon and walking abilities, a large area of tendon
      tumor was excised, followed by reconstruction with a tibialis posterior
      allograft, which is the second strongest tendon in the foot and ankle. Although
      the use of this type of graft is uncommon, the final result was satisfactory. At 
      the 10-month follow-up examination, the patient could walk easily without pain.
      This case report suggests that the surgical procedure will provide an alternative
      for the repair of large-area degenerative Achilles tendons.

AB  - The focus will be on xanthomatosis, a tissue danger signal which needs to be
      recognized by the clinician, and its relationship with monogenetic lipoprotein
      disorders (cholesterol, triglycerides), bile acid and sterol metabolism,
      particularly on metabolic pathways and genetics as well as on musculoskeletal and
      cardiovascular involvement, and their implications for clinical management. The
      critical question is to assess coronary heart disease risk, requiring correct
      identification of the pattern of lipoprotein disorders and of the causes (primary
      or secondary). Familial hypercholesterolemia must be suspected in adults and
      children with raised total cholesterol, especially when there is a personal or a 
      family history of premature coronary heart disease, usually requiring potent
      statins to achieve adequate LDL-cholesterol lowering, even if we do not know
      safety of long-term therapy and whether treatments of dyslipidemia early in life 
      prevent cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a
      treatable disease and must be suspected if there is a history of infantile
      chronic diarrhea and/or juvenile cataracts, even in the absence of tendon
      xanthomas. Current evidence for the prevention and screening, diagnosis, and
      treatment of dyslipidemia are available for the clinicians.

LID - 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2011.10.008 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive, lipid storage
      disorder which is extremely rare in the Chinese population. It is characterized
      by progressive neurologic dysfunction and enlargement of tendon xanthomas, and is
      often accompanied with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Few reports are available
      regarding depression and antidepressant medication in CTX patients. Here, we
      report a Chinese case of CTX associated with fluoxetine-responsive major
      depression.

TI  - Cytochrome P450s in the synthesis of cholesterol and bile acids--from mouse
      models to human diseases.
PG  - 1516-33

AB  - The present review describes the transgenic mouse models that have been designed 
      to evaluate the functions of the cytochrome P450s involved in cholesterol and
      bile acid synthesis, as well as their link with disease. The knockout of
      cholesterogenic Cyp51 is embrionally lethal, with symptoms of Antley-Bixler
      syndrome occurring in mice, whereas the evidence for this association is
      conflicting in humans. Disruption of Cyp7a1 from classic bile acid synthesis in
      mice leads to either increased postnatal death or a milder phenotype with
      elevated serum cholesterol. The latter is similar to the case in humans, where
      CYP7A1 mutations associate with high plasma low-density lipoprotein and hepatic
      cholesterol content, as well as deficient bile acid excretion. Disruption of
      Cyp8b1 from an alternative bile acid pathway results in the absence of cholic
      acid and a reduced absorption of dietary lipids; however, the human CYP8B1
      polymorphism fails to explain differences in bile acid composition. Unexpectedly,
      apparently normal Cyp27a1(-/-) mice still synthesize bile acids that originate
      from the compensatory pathway. In humans, CYP27A1 mutations cause
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, suggesting that only mice can compensate for the 
      loss of alternative bile acid synthesis. In line with this, Cyp7b1 knockouts are 
      also apparently normal, whereas human CYP7B1 mutations lead to a congenital bile 
      acid synthesis defect in children or spastic paraplegia in adults. Mouse
      knockouts of the brain-specific Cyp46a1 have reduced brain cholesterol excretion,
      whereas, in humans, CYP46A1 polymorphisms associate with cognitive impairment. At
      present, cytochrome P450 family 39 is poorly characterized. Despite important
      physiological differences between humans and mice, mouse models prove to be an
      invaluable tool for understanding the multifactorial facets of cholesterol and
      bile acid-related disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare lipid-storage disease.
      We investigated the clinic manifestation, histopathology and sterol
      27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A1) in a Chinese family with Cerebrotendinous
      Xanthomatosis (CTX). CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old female with typical CTX
      clinical manifestation had Spindle-shaped lipid crystal clefts in xanthomas and
      "onion-like demyelination" in sural nerve. The patient was compound heterozygote 
      carrying two deletions in exon 1 (c.73delG) and exon 2 (c.369_375delGTACCCA). The
      family memebers were carriers. CONCLUSIONS: A Chinese family with
      Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis had typical clinical manifestation. CYP27A1
      mutations were found in the proband and all other family members.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejmg.2011.08.003 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage 
      disease caused by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) deficiency. We report three CTX
      siblings that shared a novel mutation of the CYP27A1 gene. These siblings
      presented with elevated cholestanol levels and typical manifestations such as
      tendon xanthomas, cataracts, osteopenia, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia
      and peripheral neuropathy. All shared the same genetic mutation,
      c.1146_1151delins and c.1214G>A of CYP27A1. All were treated with 750 mg/day
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). In conclusion, one should consider the possibility 
      of CTX in any individual with normocholesterolemic xanthomatosis, early-onset
      cataracts, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Two unrelated individuals were referred to Lipid Clinics in The Netherlands and
      Chile with extreme xanthomatosis and hypercholesterolemia. Both were diagnosed
      with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) after molecular genetic
      analysis of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Since heFH by itself
      could not account for the massive xanthomas, the presence of an additional
      hereditary lipid or lipoprotein disorder was suspected. Further genetic analysis 
      revealed homozygozity for mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene, confirming
      the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Markedly, the typical
      neurological manifestations of CTX were absent, suggestive of a protective role
      of LDL-receptor deficiency against the severe neurological consequences of CTX.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, inherited autosomal-recessive
      lipid-storage disorder caused by 27-hydroxylase deficiency. In this study, we
      report of a 30-year old man with this disorder who was treated using
      chenodeoxycholic acid, simvastatin, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis. 
      The LDL apheresis was performed weekly for nine months. The first subjective
      improvement was reported by the patient after his fourth LDL-apheresis.
      Spasticity, gait disturbances, and his entire psychomotoric test results had
      improved tremendously. His fine motoric skills have been regained. The efficacy
      of LDL-apheresis was monitored using quantitative determination of
      7alpha-OH-4-cholesten-3-one in plasma based on a LC-MS/MS method. The clearance
      efficacy of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one from the patient's plasma per
      LDL-apheresis varied between 8% and 53% but returned to the initial high levels
      after seven days (mean value 241 ng/mL). A slight negative trend in the plasma
      concentration could be derived over the period of nine months.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal 
      recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene resulting in
      sterol-27-hydroxylase deficiency. Current information about CTX is based mainly
      on case reports, with only few large series reported. Although perceived as a
      potentially treatable condition, efficacy of chenodeoxycholic acid plus statin
      therapy remains unclear. To perform a nationwide survey of confirmed cases, with 
      a thorough analysis of genotype-phenotype data and prognostic factors. METHODS:
      Retrospective review of the clinical and epidemiological aspects and mutations of
      all the patients diagnosed since 1992 in the main reference centers for genetic
      testing of CTX in Spain. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients from 19 families were
      identified. An average delay of 19 years was observed between symptom onset and
      clinical diagnosis. Two main clinical subgroups were recognizable: a classic form
      (cerebellar and other supratentorial symptoms) and a spinal form (chronic
      myelopathy). Cholestanol levels did not correlate with clinical presentation,
      severity or response to therapy. Despite treatment, five patients died during
      follow-up, one to 4 years after diagnosis. Thirteen different mutations were
      identified, with a higher frequency of p.R395C in Northwestern Spain and p.R405W 
      in Southern Spain. None of the mutations could be associated with a particular
      clinical feature combination or prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      nationwide extensive series of CTX reported in Spain. The higher number of cases 
      in some areas suggests a possible founder effect. Spinal forms had a less severe 
      prognosis. A delayed diagnosis could contribute to the lack of significant
      response to treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare lipid-storage disease.
      Neuromuscular abnormality and autonomic system (ANS) dysfuction in CTX are rarely
      examined in large-scale studies in the literature. We studied the peripheral
      nervous system, myopathology, and autonomic system of four CTX patients and
      performed a literature review of the reported CTX patients with peripheral
      neuropathy. METHODS: Four biochemically and genetically confirmed CTX patients,
      belonging to two families, were included for study and all received nerve
      conduction study (NCS), muscle biopsy for histopathologic and ultrastructural
      study, skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber (INEF) density measurement,
      autonomic testings including sympathetic skin response, R-R interval variation
      and head-up tilt test using an automated tilt table to record the changes of
      blood pressure and heart rate in different postures. The Q-Sweat test was also
      applied for the detection of sweat amount and onset time of response. The
      clinical characteristics, study methods and results of 13 studies of peripheral
      neuropathy in CTX patients in the literature were also recorded for analysis.
      RESULTS: The results of NCS study showed axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy in
      three CTX cases and mixed axonal and demyelinating sensor-motor polyneuropathy in
      one. The myopathological and histopathologic studies revealed mild denervation
      characteristics, but the ultrastructural study revealed changes of mitochondria
      and the membranous system, and increased amounts of glycogen, lipofuscin and
      lipid deposition. The ANS study revealed different degrees of abnormalities in
      the applied tests and the INEF density measurement showed small fiber neuropathy 
      in three of the four CTX patients. The literature review of peripheral neuropathy
      in CTX revealed different types of peripheral neuropathy, of which axonal
      peripheral neuropathy was the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral neuropathy,
      especially the subtype of axonal sensori-motor neuropathy, is common in patients 
      with CTX. Evidence of lipid metabolic derangement in CTX can be reflected in
      ultrastructural studies of muscles. With an adequate multi-parametric evaluation,
      a high incidence of ANS abnormalities can be seen in this rare lipid-storage
      disease, and a high incidence of small fiber involvement is also reflected in the
      IENF density measurement of skin biopsies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal-recessive 
      disease due to mutations of the 27alpha-hydroxylase. It is characterized by
      cataracts, xanthomas, and neurological manifestations. Polyneuropathy has been
      reported, although it is unclear whether it is axonal or demyelinating. METHODS: 
      We report clinical and neurophysiological results of 13 patients with CTX
      diagnosed in Spain. RESULTS: In 8 patients (62%), peripheral neuropathy was
      demonstrated (4 demyelinating, 3 axonal, and 1 mixed; 3 predominantly motor and 5
      sensorimotor). All patients had clinical signs/symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
      Upper limb somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were affected in 38% of
      patients, and lower limb SSEPs in 67%. Fifty percent of patients had delayed
      brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and 43% had affected visual evoked
      potentials. DISCUSSION: In this series, polyneuropathy was predominantly
      sensorimotor and demyelinating. Neurophysiological studies correlated only
      partially with clinical follow-up. Therefore, we recommend neurophysiological
      follow-up studies only if clinical symptoms are present.

TI  - [Usefulness of cholestanol levels in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
PG  - 397-404
LID - 10.1016/j.nrl.2010.12.009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive
      disease caused by a deficiency of mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydrolylase.
      Such a deficiency results in a reduced production of chenodeoxycholic acid and in
      an increased formation of cholestanol. It is clinically characterized by
      cataracts, diarrhoea, xanthomas, premature arteriosclerosis and a number of
      progressive neurological symptoms. Although cholestanol levels are used for the
      diagnosis of CTX, their correlation with the clinical symptoms and their
      prognostic usefulness have not been assessed so far. METHODS: we reviewed 14 CTX 
      patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2008 in two reference centres for the genetic
      diagnosis of this disorder, whose cholestanol levels had been recorded. We
      studied the main demographic, clinical and therapeutical data and their
      correlation with plasma cholestanol levels. RESULTS: the average cholestanol
      level at diagnosis was 105.8 mumol/l. These levels did not correlate with any
      neurological symptoms or with disability at diagnosis scored by the EDSS. After
      treatment, all patients achieved a significant reduction in plasma cholestanol
      levels (average reduction of 91 mumol/l in an average follow-up of 34 months),
      although only one patient remained clinically stable. CONCLUSIONS: high
      cholestanol levels are very useful for diagnosis of CTX but they do not have a
      prognostic value (they do not correlate with severity). Normalisation of
      cholestanol levels is not always associated with clinical stabilisation. However,
      follow-up of cholestanol levels can be useful for the dose adjustment.

TI  - Insufficient bile acid signaling impairs liver repair in CYP27(-/-) mice.
PG  - 885-95
LID - 10.1016/j.jhep.2010.12.037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies indicate that bile acids (BAs) promote normal
      liver regeneration and repair after injury. However, the impact of insufficient
      BA signaling, which is observed in patients with BA sequestrant medication or
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) disease, on liver injury is still unknown.
      Our aim is to determine the outcomes of reduced BA levels upon liver injury.
      METHODS: Seventy percent partial hepatectomy (PH) and carbon tetrachloride
      (CCl(4)) treatment were performed using CYP27(-/-) mice, a genetic animal model
      with low BA levels. The liver repair of CYP27(-/-) mice after the treatments was 
      characterized by histological staining, chemical analysis, and quantitative
      real-time PCR. RESULTS: CYP27(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced CCl(4)-induce liver
      injury, and defective liver regeneration and prolonged steatosis after 70% PH.
      Due to the insufficient BA signaling, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activities were 
      significantly reduced in CYP27(-/-) livers after 70% PH. Activation of FXR by
      either 0.2% cholic acid feeding or oral infusion of an FXR agonist greatly
      promoted liver regeneration in CYP27(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Normal physiological
      levels of BAs are required for liver repair. Patients with BA sequestrant
      medications or CTX disease due to CYP27 gene mutations may have an increased risk
      of liver failure, and treatment with FXR ligands can promote liver regeneration
      of patients with low BA levels.

AB  - A 32-year-old male patient presented with uncontrolled convulsions to the
      emergency room. He had epilepsy since childhood and was on tablet phenytoin
      sodium 100 mg three times a day. However, on detailed history elicitation and
      clinical examination, he was found to have a constellation of findings. He had
      multiple swellings over both the lower limbs and upper limbs at the site of
      various tendon insertions (xanthomas), mental retardation, speech disturbance,
      bilateral pyramidal tract involvement and bilateral cataracts. Based on clinical 
      features, a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a relatively rare
      genetic disorder was suspected, and later on confirmed histopathologically.

TI  - Profiling sterols in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: utility of Girard
      derivatization and high resolution exact mass LC-ESI-MS(n) analysis.
PG  - 1384-92
LID - 10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.11.019 [doi]
AB  - In this study we profile free 3-oxo sterols present in plasma from patients
      affected with the neurodegenerative disorder of sterol and bile acid metabolism
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), utilizing a combination of charge-tagging
      and LC-ESI-MS(n) performed with an LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery instrument. In
      addition, we profile sterols in plasma from 24-month-old cyp27A1 gene knockout
      mice lacking the enzyme defective in CTX. Charge-tagging was accomplished by
      reaction with cationic Girard's P (GP) reagent 1-(carboxymethyl) pyridinium
      chloride hydrazide, an approach uniquely suited to studying the 3-oxo sterols
      that accumulate in CTX, as Girard's reagent reacts with the sterol oxo moiety to 
      form charged hydrazone derivatives. The ability to selectively generate GP-tagged
      3-oxo-4-ene and 3-oxo-5(H) saturated plasma sterols enabled ESI-MS(n) analysis of
      these sterols in the presence of a large excess (3 orders of magnitude) of
      cholesterol. Often cholesterol detected in biological samples makes it
      challenging to quantify minor sterols, with cholesterol frequently removed prior 
      to analysis. We derivatized plasma (10 mul) without SPE removal of cholesterol to
      ensure detection of all sterols present in plasma. We were able to measure
      4-cholesten-3-one in plasma from untreated CTX patients (1207+/-302 ng/ml,
      mean+/-SD, n=4), as well as other intermediates in a proposed pathway to
      5alpha-cholestanol. In addition, a number of bile acid precursors were identified
      in plasma using this technique. GP-tagged sterols were identified utilizing high 
      resolution exact mass spectra (+/-5 ppm), as well as MS(2) ([M](+)-->) spectra
      that possessed characteristic neutral loss of 79Da (pyridine) fragment ions, and 
      MS(3) ([M](+)-->[M-79](+)-->) spectra that provided additional structurally
      informative fragment ions.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare recessive autosomal disease caused by
      mutations of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27), which leads to reduced
      synthesis of bile acids, particularly chenodeoxycholic acid (Cali et al, J Biol
      Chem. 1991;266:7779-7783; Gallus et al, Neurol Sci. 2006;27:143-149). The disease
      is characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction due to accumulation of
      cholestanol in neurologic tissues (Moghadasian et al, Arch Neurol.
      2002;59:527-529; Selva-O'Callaghan et al, Rheumatology. 2007;46:1212-1213).
      Long-term treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid can arrest or even reverse
      progression of the disease (Pierre et al, J Inherit Metab Dis. In press).Brain
      SPECT with 740 MBq of Tc-99m ethyl cysteinate dimmer, using a double-head gamma
      camera (Siemens E.cam) with high-resolution, low-energy parallel collimators was 
      performed in our patient at onset and 2 years after starting chenodeoxycholic
      acid treatment. SPECT acquisitions were performed using a 360-degree orbit, 1
      image/30 seg/3 degree, and 128 x 128 matrix. Reconstruction was by means of
      filtered back-projection, Butterworth 5/0.25, without attenuation correction.
      Pre- and post-SPECT dicom images were reoriented into Talairach space using
      NeuroGam (Segami Corporation). To visually identify abnormal perfusion regions,
      volume render brain image was computed, where abnormal perfusion regions were
      found by comparing with age-matched normal database, and Brodmann areas (BA) were
      quantified. Pre- versus post-treatment changes were computed by means of relative
      percentage between counts. Post-treatment SPECT showed better perfusion than
      pretreatment SPECT with an increase between 5% and 10% in frontal cortex (BA 9,
      BA 24, BA 32, BA 46, BA 47), parietal cortex (BA 5, BA 31), and temporal cortex
      (BA 20, BA 22, BA 28, BA 36, BA 37, BA 38), and with an increase of more than 10%
      in frontal cortex (BA 45) and parietal cortex (BA 23). This case illustrates the 
      benefit of bile acid therapy for halting and even reversing neurologic
      retardation in this condition.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare neurometabolic disease due to
      defective activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase, with plasma and tissue cholestanol
      storage. Clinical phenotype is characterized by both systemic manifestations and 
      neurological signs. Therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) suppresses abnormal
      bile acid synthesis. The purpose of the study was to assess the frequency and
      clinical relevance of spasticity in the CTX phenotype and to study the usefulness
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in detecting corticospinal tract
      damage and monitoring the effects of replacement therapy. Twenty-four CTX
      patients underwent clinical evaluation including general disability scores,
      pyramidal and cerebellar function scales, assessment of serum cholestanol and
      TMS. Nine patients who started CDCA therapy at baseline received clinical and
      neurophysiological follow up. All patients showed signs of pyramidal damage which
      were relevant for clinical disability in 18 out of 24 cases (75%), resulting in
      spastic paraparesis. TMS revealed corticospinal alterations even in subjects with
      mild clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement. After CDCA treatment,
      serum cholestanol decreased to normal concentrations in all patients. Clinical
      picture was unchanged in seven out of nine cases; in two others pyramidal signs
      disappeared. A reduction in abnormal neurophysiological parameters was found.
      Spastic paraparesis is the most frequent and relevant neurological feature in CTX
      patients. Replacement treatment with CDCA can prevent the progression of
      pyramidal damage, especially if started early in the course of the disease. TMS
      represents a sensitive indicator of corticospinal tract dysfunction and
      subclinical improvements in pyramidal function after CDCA therapy.

PG  - 361-4
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage 
      disorder due to a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase
      (CYP 27) with reduced or no chenodeoxycholic synthesis. This deficiency leads to 
      an accumulation of cholestanol in different sites such as the eye lens, central
      nervous system or tendons. We report a 64-year-old female patient with a
      progressive gait disorder associated with cognitive decline since the age of 59. 
      The patient had no mental retardation, cataract or chronic diarrhea. Her family
      reported increasing behavioral modifications 10 years previously. Clinical
      examination revealed a spastic paraplegia and bilateral xanthomas on the Achilles
      tendons. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse hyperintense 
      T2 abnormalities in the pyramidal tracts from the internal capsules to the
      cerebral peduncles also Technetium-99m-ECD brain SPECT showed a severe cerebellar
      hypoperfusion. Serum cholestanol analysis was 7 micromol/l (N). After 2 years,
      she was bedridden and died of aspiration pneumonia. The neuropathological study
      confirmed the CTX diagnosis and the sequencing analysis revealed that she was
      compound heterozygous for two mutations in the CYP27A1 gene: 1435 C > T (exon 7) 
      on one allele and a new mutation, 1017 G > C (exon 5) on the other. The interest 
      of the present case is to report neuropathology findings strongly correlated with
      the MRI and SPECT abnormalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify total and regional brain damage in subjects with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) using MR based quantitative measures.
      BACKGROUND: CTX is a rare inherited disorder characterised by progressive
      neurological impairment. Appropriate therapy can slow disease progression.
      Measures of brain volume changes have been used in several neurological disorders
      due to their value in assessing disease outcome and monitoring patients'
      evolution. METHODS: 24 CTX patients underwent conventional MRI to measure total
      and regional brain volumes. In five CTX patients who started therapy at baseline,
      clinical and MRI examinations were repeated after 2 years. Clinical disability,
      overall cognitive performance and cerebellar function were evaluated using the
      modified Rankin Scale (RS), Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and cerebellar 
      functional system score (CB-FSS). RESULTS: Measures of normalised brain, cortical
      and cerebellar volumes were lower in CTX patients than in healthy controls
      (p<0.01). Instead, there were no differences in normalised white matter volumes
      between the two groups (p=0.1). At regional analysis, a significant volume
      decrease was found in each cortical region (p<0.01 for all regions). Normalised
      cortical volumes correlated closely with age (r=-0.9, p<0.0001), RS (r=-0.65,
      p<0.001) and MMSE (r=-0.60, p<0.01). Normalised cerebellar volumes correlated
      closely with CB-FSS scores (r=-0.58, p<0.01). In the five CTX patients followed
      over time, the annual brain volume decrease was -1.1 +/- 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cortical volume, rather than white matter volume, is diffusely decreased in CTX
      patients and correlates closely with the patient's clinical status. These data
      provide evidence for the presence of clinically relevant neuronal-axonal damage
      in the brains of CTX patients.

AB  - Mutations of the gene encoding the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase
      (CYP27A1 gene) cause defects in the cholesterol pathway to bile acids that lead
      to the storage of cholestanol and cholesterol in tendons, lenses and the central 
      nervous system. This disorder is the cause of a clinical syndrome known as
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Since 1991 several mutations of the CYP27A1
      gene have been reported. We diagnosed the clinical features of CTX in a caucasian
      woman. Serum levels of cholestanol and 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol were elevated
      and the concentration of 27-hydroxycholesterol was reduced. Bile alcohols in the 
      urine and faeces were increased. The analysis of the CYP27A1 gene showed that the
      patient was a compound heterozygote carrying two mutations both located in exon
      8. One mutation is a novel four nucleotide deletion (c.1330-1333delTTCC) that
      results in a frameshift and the occurrence of a premature stop codon leading to
      the formation of a truncated protein of 448 amino acids. The other mutation,
      previously reported, is a C - > T transition (c. c.1381C > T) that converts the
      glutamine codon at position 461 into a termination codon (p.Q461X). These
      truncated proteins are expected to have no biological function being devoid of
      the cysteine residue at position 476 of the normal enzyme that is crucial for
      heme binding and enzyme activity.

AB  - The Israeli population mainly includes Jews, Muslim and Christian Arabs, and
      Druze In the last decade, data on genetic diseases present in the population have
      been systematically collected and are available online in the Israeli national
      genetic database ( http://www.goldenhelix.org/server/israeli ). In the non-Jewish
      population, up to 1 July 2010, the database included molecular data on six
      diseases relatively frequent in the whole population: thalassemia, familial
      Mediterranean fever (FMF), cystic fibrosis, deafness, phenylketonuria and
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia, as well as data on 195 autosomal recessive
      diseases among Muslim Israeli Arabs, 11 among the Christian Arabs and 31 among
      Druze. A single mutation was characterized in 149 out of the 238 rare disorders
      for which the molecular basis was known. In many diseases, mutation had never
      been observed in any other population and was present in one family only
      suggesting that it occurred as a de novo event. In other diseases, the mutation
      was present in more than one community or even in other populations such as
      Bedouins from the Arab peninsula or Christians from Lebanon. In the 89 other
      disorders, more than one mutation was characterized either in the same gene or in
      more than one gene. While it is probable that most of these cases represent
      random events in some cases such as Bardet Biedl among the Bedouins, the reason
      may be a selective advantage to the heterozygotes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare genetic disorder.
      Recent studies show that brain damage in CTX patients extends beyond the
      abnormalities observed on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We
      studied the MRI and 99 mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) findings of CTX patients and made a correlation with the
      neuropsychological presentations. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D 
      T1-weighted images of five CTX patients were compared with 15 age-matched
      controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was use to delineate gray matter (GM) and
      white matter (WM) volume loss. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD),
      and eigenvalues derived from DTI were used to detect WM changes and correlate
      with neuropsychological results. SPECT functional studies were used to correlate 
      with GM changes. RESULTS: Cognitive results showed that aside from moderate
      mental retardation, the patient group performed worse in all cognitive domains.
      Despite the extensive GM atrophy pattern, the cerebellum, peri-Sylvian regions
      and parietal-occipital regions were correlated with SPECT results. WM atrophy
      located in the peri-dentate and left cerebral peduncle areas corresponded with
      changes in diffusion measures, while axial and radial diffusivity suggested both 
      demyelinating and axonal changes. Changes in FA and MD were preceded by VBM in
      the corpus callosum and corona radiata. Cognitive results correlated with FA
      changes. CONCLUSION: In CTX, GM atrophy affected the perfusion patterns. Changes 
      in WM included atrophy, and axonal changes with demyelination. Disconnection of
      major fiber tracts among different cortical regions may contribute to cognitive
      impairment.

TI  - Identification of a novel missense mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in 
      two Japanese patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1127-31
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive sterol storage
      disease caused by a mutated sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) gene. We analyzed the
      CYP27A1 gene in two Japanese CTX patients. The CYP27A1 gene was amplified by PCR 
      and screened by PCR-SSCP. The nucleotide sequence was analyzed to confirm
      mutations. Case 1 was a compound heterozygote for Arg104Gln in exon 2 and
      Arg441Gln in exon 8. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which the
      Arg104Gln mutation is identified in CTX patients. Probably case 2 would be a
      compound heterozygote for Arg441Trp in exon 8 and a mutation that was not
      identified.

TI  - On the mechanism of accumulation of cholestanol in the brain of mice with a
      disruption of sterol 27-hydroxylase.
PG  - 2722-30
LID - 10.1194/jlr.M008326 [doi]
AB  - The rare disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is due to a lack of sterol 
      27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and is characterized by cholestanol-containing xanthomas
      in brain and tendons. Mice with the same defect do not develop xanthomas. The
      driving force in the development of the xanthomas is likely to be conversion of a
      bile acid precursor into cholestanol. The mechanism behind the xanthomas in the
      brain has not been clarified. We demonstrate here that female cyp27a1(-/-) mice
      have an increase of cholestanol of about 2.5- fold in plasma, 6-fold in tendons, 
      and 12-fold in brain. Treatment of cyp27a1(-/-) mice with 0.05% cholic acid
      normalized the cholestanol levels in tendons and plasma and reduced the content
      in the brain. The above changes occurred in parallel with changes in plasma
      levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a precursor both to bile acids and
      cholestanol. Injection of a cyp27a1(-/-) mouse with (2)H(7)-labeled
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one resulted in a significant incorporation of
      (2)H(7)-cholestanol in the brain. The results are consistent with a
      concentration-dependent flux of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one across the
      blood-brain barrier in cyp27a1(-/-) mice and subsequent formation of cholestanol.
      It is suggested that the same mechanism is responsible for accumulation of
      cholestanol in the brain of patients with CTX.

PG  - 46-9
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.02.140 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis [CTX] is a rare disease characterized by the
      accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in brain and tendons caused by a
      mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene [CYP27A1] involved in bile acid
      synthesis. Disruption of this gene in mice does not give rise to xanthomas. The
      gene defect leads to reduced bile acid synthesis with a compensatory increase in 
      the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol
      7alpha-hydroxylase. This leads to a marked accumulation of 7alpha-hydroxylated
      bile acid precursors, in particular 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. The latter 
      oxysterol passes the blood-brain barrier and is an efficient precursor to
      cholestanol. The activity of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase is normalized by
      treatment with bile acids. Such treatment reduces the xanthomas in CTX patients
      in parallel with decreased cholestanol levels. The relationship between the
      accumulation of cholestanol and the development of cholesterol-rich xanthomas has
      however not been clarified and a suitable animal model is still lacking.

AB  - Cholesterol is an essential component of both the peripheral and central nervous 
      systems of mammals. Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated that
      disturbances in cholesterol metabolism are associated with the development of
      various neurological conditions. In addition to genetically defined defects in
      cholesterol synthesis, which will be covered in another review in this Thematic
      Series, defects in cholesterol metabolism (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) and
      intracellular transport (Niemann Pick Syndrome) lead to neurological disease. A
      subform of hereditary spastic paresis (type SPG5) and Huntington's disease are
      neurological diseases with mutations in genes that are of importance for
      cholesterol metabolism. Neurodegeneration is generally associated with
      disturbances in cholesterol metabolism, and presence of the E4 isoform of the
      cholesterol transporter apolipoprotein E as well as hypercholesterolemia are
      important risk factors for development of Alzheimer's disease. In the present
      review, we discuss the links between genetic disturbances in cholesterol
      metabolism and the above neurological disorders.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): an association of pulverulent cataracts and
      pseudo-dominant developmental delay in a family with a splice site mutation in
      CYP27A1--a case report.
PG  - 73-6
LID - 10.3109/13816810903584963 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A 15-year-old boy with developmental delay presented to the pediatric
      ophthalmology clinic with bilateral pulverulent cataracts. The family was
      examined for developmental delay, cataracts and systemic problems. METHODS: The
      parents were consanguineous and originally from Bangladesh. All the children were
      born in the UK. The mother and 5 children had developmental delay. Three children
      had global developmental delay, diarrhea and pulverulent cataracts. Two children 
      had microcephaly, developmental delay, constipation and no cataracts. The mother 
      did not have microcephaly, cataracts or gastrointestinal problems. Linkage
      analysis via autozygosity testing was performed for detection of loci and
      candidate genes. The patients with cataracts were segregated with homozygous
      mutations in the CYP27A1 (G to A substitution at position +1 of intron 6).
      RESULTS: The complex nature of this family's findings suggested that it had an
      unusual autosomal dominant condition with variable expression. Autozygosity
      testing demonstrated that three members had Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX),
      which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The aetiology of the
      developmental delay in other family members remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive condition that can
      result in neurological deficits and early death if left untreated. In view of the
      reversible nature of the condition with appropriate treatment, there needs to be 
      a high level of suspicion of CTX for any child with cataracts and developmental
      delay even if the pattern of inheritance is not straightforward at initial
      assessment.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presenting with severe externalized disorder:
      improvement after one year of treatment with chenodeoxycholic Acid.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare inborn disorder of sterol storage 
      with autosomal recessive inheritance and a variable clinical presentation. We
      describe two siblings with an early psychiatric presentation of CTX-associated
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, also 
      associated with a mild intellectual disability and major behavioral impairments. 
      In both cases, treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid improved externalized
      symptoms and a partial recovery of cognitive impairments was observed. This
      suggests that CTX is potentially reversible, demonstrating the need for early
      diagnosis and treatment of this disorder before irreversible neurological lesions
      can occur.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal 
      recessive disease, because of sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency. Clinical
      manifestations of CTX are tendon xanthomas, juvenile cataracts, osteoporosis,
      diarrhoea and multiple progressive neurological dysfunctions. More than 300
      patients with CTX have been reported to date worldwide and about fifty different 
      mutations identified in CYP27A1 gene. This study describes the clinical and
      laboratory findings of seven new patients. METHODS: We report the molecular and
      clinical characterization of seven new Italian patients with CTX carrying four
      novel mutations. RESULTS: We identified four novel mutations located in different
      exons, in particular in the region of exons 2-5 of the CYP27A1 gene. Phenotypical
      expression did not differ from classical CTX presentation except for absence of
      tendon xanthomas in two patients.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is one of the rare forms of treatable hereditary
      neurodegenerative disorders. It is due to a defect in hydroxylation of
      cholesterol side chain that impairs oxidative cleavage of cholesterol leading to 
      excess accumulation of cholesterol. Here we present such a case which presented
      to us with recurrent generalized tonic clonic seizures. He is under treatment for
      the same and has not neurologically deteriorated since then.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease characterized by 
      infantile-onset diarrhea, childhood-onset cataract, adolescent- to young
      adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurologic dysfunction 
      (dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, dystonia,
      atypical parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures). Chronic diarrhea
      from infancy may be the earliest clinical manifestation. In approximately 75% of 
      affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, often appearing in the
      first decade of life. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur 
      on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar 
      tendon, and the neck tendons. Xanthomas have been reported in the lung, bones,
      and central nervous system. Some individuals show mental impairment from early
      infancy, whereas the majority have normal or only slightly subnormal intellectual
      function until puberty; dementia with slow deterioration in intellectual
      abilities occurs in the 20s in more than 50% of individuals. Neuropsychiatric
      symptoms such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, aggression,
      depression, and suicide attempts may be prominent. Pyramidal signs (i.e.,
      spasticity) and/or cerebellar signs almost invariably become evident between ages
      20 and 30 years. CTX is diagnosed by clinical findings and biochemical testing.
      The biochemical abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with
      xanthomas include: high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration,
      normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration; decreased chenodeoxycholic acid; 
      increased concentration of bile alcohols and their glyconjugates; and increased
      concentrations of cholestanol and apolipoprotein B in cerebrospinal fluid.
      CYP27A1 is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis. Treatment of manifestations: Long-term treatment with
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) normalizes bile acid synthesis, normalizes plasma
      and CSF concentration of cholestanol, and improves neurophysiologic findings.
      Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase alone or in combination with CDCA are also
      effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration and improving clinical signs;
      however, they may induce muscle damage. Cataract extraction is typically required
      in at least one eye by age 50 years. Epilepsy, spasticity, and parkinsonism are
      treated symptomatically. Surveillance: Annual neurologic and neuropsychological
      evaluation, cholestanol plasma concentration, brain MRI, echocardiogram, and
      assessment of total body density (TBD). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early
      diagnosis by biochemical testing or molecular genetic testing if the two
      disease-causing mutations in the family are known allows for early treatment that
      may prevent or limit disease manifestations. CTX is inherited in an autosomal
      recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25%
      chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk
      family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are
      possible if both disease-causing mutations in the family are known.

AB  - CTX is a rare lipid-storage disease. Novel MRS findings from 3 patients, using a 
      short TE, were the presence of lipid peaks at 0.9 and 1.3 ppm in the depth of the
      cerebellar hemisphere; this might represent an additional marker of disease that 
      is CNS-specific and noninvasive. A decrease in NAA concentration was also
      detected and attributed to neuroaxonal damage. One patient presented an increase 
      in mIns concentration, pointing to gliosis and astrocytic proliferation.

TI  - Oxysterols from free radical chain oxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol: product and
      mechanistic studies.
PG  - 2222-32
LID - 10.1021/ja9080265 [doi]
AB  - Free radical chain oxidation of highly oxidizable 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC),
      initiated by 2,2'-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), was carried out at
      37 degrees C in benzene for 24 h. Fifteen oxysterols derived from 7-DHC were
      isolated and characterized with 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.
      A mechanism that involves abstraction of hydrogen atoms at C-9 and/or C-14 is
      proposed to account for the formation of all of the oxysterols and the reaction
      progress profile. In either the H-9 or H-14 mechanism, a pentadienyl radical
      intermediate is formed after abstraction of H-9 or H-14 by a peroxyl radical.
      This step is followed by the well-precedented transformations observed in
      peroxidation reactions of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as oxygen addition,
      peroxyl radical 5-exo cyclization, and S(H)i carbon radical attack on the
      peroxide bond. The mechanism for peroxidation of 7-DHC also accounts for the
      formation of numerous oxysterol natural products isolated from fungal species,
      marine sponges, and cactaceous species. In a cell viability test, the oxysterol
      mixture from 7-DHC peroxidation was found to be cytotoxic to Neuro2a
      neuroblastoma cells in the micromolar concentration range. We propose that the
      high reactivity of 7-DHC and the oxysterols generated from its peroxidation may
      play important roles in the pathogenesis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, X-linked 
      dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, all of
      these being metabolic disorders characterized by an elevated level of 7-DHC.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients with and without parkinsonism: clinical
      characteristics and neuroimaging findings.
PG  - 452-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.22979 [doi]
AB  - Parkinsonism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is rare. There are no
      published studies with imaging findings of dopamine transporter using
      (99m)Tc-[2-[[2-[[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3,2,1] oct-2-yl]
      methyl] (2-mercaptoethyl) amino] ethyl]
      amino]-ethanethiolato(3-)-N2,N2,S2,S2]oxo-[1R-(exo-exo)] ((99m)Tc-TRODAT-1) SPECT
      in CTX patients. This report is on the clinical details of five
      genetically-proven CTX patients (two with and three without parkinsonism).
      Imaging findings using cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and
      (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT are also shown. Clinical correlation of neuroimaging
      findings and clinical presentations was made. A literature review of the clinical
      and neuroimaging features of eight CTX patients with parkinsonism reported in the
      English literature is also presented. The parkinsonian features of our two cases 
      and the other eight reported cases occurred before the age of 50 years. The MR
      imaging study showed variable findings, in which, besides the common diffuse
      cerebral and cerebellar white matter lesions shown in CTX, several focal brain
      lesions were also noted. Of the focal lesions, substantia nigra abnormalities
      were seen only in the two cases with parkinsonism. The (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT
      study showed different degrees of unilateral or bilateral abnormalities in the
      striatal binding in both visual and semiquantitative assessments. parkinsonism
      can be one of the neurologic presentations of CTX. Even though abnormal findings 
      of the substantia nigra were detected in both of our CTX patients with
      parkinsonism, basal ganglion lesions have not been uniformly described in MR
      imaging findings of reported CTX patients with parkinsonism. (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1
      SPECT study can be of value in the detection of striatal involvement, and the
      study results also suggest pre-synaptic dopamine neuron involvement in CTX
      patients with parkinsonism.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease inherited in a
      autosomal recessive way. CTX is characterised by childhood-onset cataract,
      adolescent to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas and adult-onset progressive
      neurological dysfunction (dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal and/or
      cerebellar signs and seizures). Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade;
      they occur on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand,
      the patellar tendon and the neck tendons. The biochemical abnormalities that
      distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and
      tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration 
      and decreased chenodeoxycholic acid. Long-term treatment of individuals with CTX 
      with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) normalises bile acid synthesis, normalises
      plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of cholestanol, and improves
      neurophysiological findings. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A
      reductase alone or in combination with CDCA are also effective in decreasing
      cholestanol concentration and improving clinical signs; however, they may induce 
      muscle symptoms.

TI  - ESI-MS/MS quantification of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one facilitates rapid,
      convenient diagnostic testing for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 43-8
LID - 10.1016/j.cca.2009.09.036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) frequently 
      remains undiagnosed for many years. Left untreated CTX is associated with the
      development of cataracts, xanthomas and severe neurological dysfunction. The
      method routinely used to screen for CTX is GC-based measurement of elevated
      5alpha-cholestanol from hydrolyzed plasma. A plasma test for CTX utilizing
      ESI-MS/MS methodology would be beneficial. METHODS: Development of rapid, simple 
      LC-ESI-MS/MS methodology to test plasma for CTX is described. Two hour Girard
      derivatization allowed for 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one quantification by
      isotope dilution LC-ESI-MS/MS within 12 min from un-hydrolyzed affected patient
      plasma (5 microl). RESULTS: Adequate sensitivity and reproducibility were
      achieved for quantification of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, which
      demonstrated improved utility as a diagnostic marker of disease and to monitor
      treatment compared to 5alpha-cholestanol. The mean plasma concentration of
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in untreated CTX-affected patients (n=6) was
      107-fold that in unaffected subjects (n=9), with the lowest concentration in
      affected patients >10-fold the highest concentration in unaffected subjects.
      CONCLUSION: Quantification of the bile acid precursor
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one with LC-ESI-MS/MS is a novel approach to
      improved diagnostic testing of plasma for CTX, amenable to high-throughput
      analysis and automated sample handling. Development of ESI-MS/MS methodology
      should make CTX testing more widely available and facilitate easier diagnosis of 
      CTX.

TI  - An alternative pathway of reverse cholesterol transport: the oxysterol
      27-hydroxycholesterol.
PG  - 39-41
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.09.015 [doi]
AB  - Reverse cholesterol transport, although not well understood, is an important
      mechanism in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Macrophages can eliminate
      some cholesterol from atherosclerotic lesions by an oxidative mechanism involving
      sterol 27-hydroxylase. Patients with inherited "cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis"
      lack sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and develop severe premature atherosclerosis
      despite normal serum cholesterol concentrations. Thus, it has been speculated
      that sterol 27-hydroxylase is an anti-atherosclerotic enzyme. Here, we report the
      case of a 25-year-old patient who presented to our emergency room with an acute
      non-ST elevation myocardial infarction due to severe coronary heart disease.
      Lipid analysis revealed dramatically increased 27-hydroxycholesterol and low
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Previous reports suggest that 
      27-hydroxylase is upregulated to protect peripheral cells from severe cholesterol
      accumulation, especially in cases of ineffective reverse cholesterol transport
      due to low HDL-cholesterol levels. Our findings indicate that oxysterols could
      play an important and so far underestimated role in reverse cholesterol
      transport.

AB  - A simple and sensitive method that dose not require derivatization for
      determining cholestanol has been developed using HPLC with electrochemical
      detection (HPLC-ECD). The current peak height was linearly related to the amount 
      of cholestanol injected, ranging from 1 to 200 muM (r = 0.999). The detection
      limit (S/N = 3) of cholestanol was 0.23 muM (1.2 pmol). Total cholestanol in
      control human and mouse serum was determined by the present method with a
      recovery rate of more than 90% and an RSD (n = 5) of less than 7.3%. Further,
      this method was successfully applied to monitor experimental hypercholestanolemia
      in mice fed a high-cholestanol diet, an animal model of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX). In conclusion, we found this method to be both simple and
      useful for the determination of cholestanol in serum, helping in the diagnosis of
      CTX.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an inherited autosomal recessive disease caused
      by a mutation in the gene for the sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme, which determines 
      the accumulation of plasmatic cholestanol in various tissues. The natural history
      of this disease is characterized by chronic diarrhea beginning in childhood,
      cataract in youth, tendinous xanthomas in adulthood and later progressive
      neurological dysfunction manifested as dementia, psychiatric disorders,
      cerebellar, pyramidal or extra pyramidal signs or seizures. We report a 39
      year-old male with a history of diarrhea during childhood and bilateral cataracts
      requiring surgery at 20 years of age, who evolves later with psychiatric
      disorders and bilateral increased volume in Achules tendons. High levels of
      plasmatic cholestanol and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of
      this disease.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): a treatable lipid storage disease.
PG  - 6-11
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage 
      disease with multi-organ involvement. The clinical manifestations usually start
      at infancy and develop during the first and second decades of life;
      infantile-onset diarrhea may be the earliest clinical manifestation of CTX.
      Additional clinical manifestations are juvenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and 
      multiple progressive neurological symptoms. Systemic manifestations that are
      often found include osteoporosis, heart involvement and premature
      arteriosclerosis. CTX is caused by mutations in the sterol 27 hydroxylase gene
      (CYP27) on chromosome 2q35-qter, which is responsible for conversion of
      cholesterol to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid. Reduced synthesis of cholic and 
      chenodeoxycholic acid results in failed feedback inhibition of cholesterol
      production, which in turn leads to increased serum cholestanol concentration and 
      elevated urinary bile alcohols. Early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)
      prevents the clinical symptoms and prevents deterioration. Although CTX is rare
      world wide, genetic islands of high frequency have been reported. In this review 
      we would like to familiarize the reader with this fatal inborn error of
      metabolism that is possibly under-diagnosed and is preventable once recognized
      and treated.

PG  - 222-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an uncommon autosomal recessive disease
      caused by mutation of the CYP27A1 gene. It is characterized by the presence of
      xanthomas in different tissues, principally brain and tendon, due to the
      accumulation of beta-cholestanol. Diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of serum 
      beta-cholestanol and urinary bile alcohol levels. Therapy with chenodeoxycholic
      acid has been shown to be the most effective treatment and can halt progression
      of the disease. We present 4 patients with a history of neurological disorders
      since childhood and who were diagnosed with CTX after developing tendon
      xanthomas. Although diagnostic suspicion depends to a large extent on recognition
      of tendon xanthomas, these are not an early sign of the disease, which can
      present with neurological disorders, cataracts, and chronic diarrhea. Early
      diagnosis of CTX therefore rests on measurement of serum beta-cholestanol levels,
      even in absence of tendon xanthomas.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) OMIM#213700 is a rare disorder of bile acid 
      synthesis caused by deficiency of the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. It results in
      deficiency of bile acids and accumulation of abnormal bile alcohols and
      accelerated cholesterol synthesis. CTX usually presents in the second or third
      decade with slowly progressive neurological dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia and
      premature atherosclerosis. Treatment with bile acid supplementation improves but 
      does not completely reverse the neurological signs and symptoms. However, CTX is 
      now known to be associated with a period of neonatal cholestasis. If it is
      diagnosed at this point, treatment may prevent the onset of neurological
      problems. We present the case histories and developmental findings in two
      affected siblings treated from infancy. We plan to continue regular
      neurodevelopmental reviews.

      treat.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an autosomal recessive disease of bile acid
      synthesis caused by 27-hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic
      acid normalizes cholestanol concentrations and abrogates progression of the
      disease. We present 4 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis within 1
      family who were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid for 14 years. Two young
      sisters started treatment at the preclinical stage before the appearance of major
      symptoms. Their 2 older uncles, who had already developed the complete phenotypic
      form of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis when diagnosed, commenced treatment at the
      same time as the sisters, thus establishing a natural control group. After 14
      years of chenodeoxycholic acid therapy, the cholestanol levels of all 4 patients 
      decreased to normal levels (<6 microg/mL). Both sisters remained asymptomatic.
      Only moderate improvement in symptoms was observed in their uncles. In this
      long-term study, prompt preclinical administration of chenodeoxycholic acid in
      early childhood completely prevented the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis phenotype
      in 2 sisters. Pediatricians should be aware of this diagnostic possibility of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in children presenting with chronic diarrhea and
      juvenile cataracts. Prevention is particularly significant in light of the
      availability of early genetic diagnosis and the devastating effects of this
      illness if not treated.

PG  - 903-9
LID - 10.1097/GIM.0b013e31818d0e0f [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Druze community is characterized by consanguinity and endogamy, and 
      by reluctance to genetic testing and technological interventions for the
      prevention of birth defects. Multiple patients with four rare and severe inborn
      errors of metabolism cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, prolidase deficiency,
      argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I
      deficiency were identified in an isolated Druze village in northern Israel. The
      aims of this study were to identify couples at risk for four inherited diseases, 
      and to prevent birth defects in a community presenting religious and cultural
      obstacles to genetic testing. METHODS: A genetic screening and counseling program
      in a high-risk community. RESULTS: The 1425 residents who attended group genetic 
      counseling sessions between 2003 and 2007 consented to genetic testing. We
      identified 217 carriers for either one or two disease causing mutations. High
      carrier frequencies for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, prolidase deficiency,
      argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I
      deficiency were identified as 1:11, 1:21, 1:41, and 1:95, respectively.
      Fifty-eight percent (125) of the carriers' spouses agreed to genetic counseling
      and testing. Ten couples at risk for affected offspring were identified and
      offered prenatal genetic counseling and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic
      screening program, the first of its kind reported in a Druze community, was well 
      received. We expect this program to increase awareness of genetic counseling, to 
      contribute to disease prevention, and to serve as a model for other isolated
      communities.

AB  - The association of genetic factors and cerebral infarction (CI) has long been
      established. A positive family history alone is a recognized risk factor for CI
      and vascular events in general. However, there are certain inherited conditions
      that further increase the risk of stroke. These conditions are generally
      metabolic and mitochondrial genetic defects that have variable modes of
      inheritance. This article reviews major inherited metabolic disorders that
      predispose an individual to CI. Ten main conditions will be discussed: Fabry's
      disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, tangier disease, familial
      hypercholesterolemia, homocystinuria, methylmalonic acidemia, glutaric aciduria
      type I, propionic acidemia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and
      mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like phenomenon.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an inborn error of bile acid synthesis in
      which hepatic conversion of cholesterol to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids is
      impaired. Patients have abnormal bile alcohols in urine, normal to increased
      plasma cholesterol concentrations and increased concentrations of plasma
      cholestanol. Little is known about cholesterol precursors in CTX, however. We
      studied cholesterol and phytosterol profiles in two siblings with CTX during
      follow-up. While cholesterol concentrations were low in both patients, plasma
      cholestanol was 6-fold higher compared to control values. In addition, both
      siblings had a more than 100-fold increase in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) and
      8-dehydrocholesterol (8DHC). Lathosterol, lanosterol and sitosterol were
      increased in both patients while concentrations of desmosterol and campesterol
      were normal. In addition, plasma lathosterol/cholesterol ratios were
      significantly elevated. After treatment with chenodeoxycholate, both patients
      showed a marked decrease in cholestanol, 7DHC, 8DHC, lathosterol, lanosterol and 
      sitosterol. In addition, the lathosterol/cholesterol ratio normalized, indicating
      that overall cholesterol synthesis was sufficiently suppressed. This study shows 
      that elevated cholesterol precursors, other than cholestanol, can be a hallmark
      for CTX.

AB  - Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are rare genetic disorders that can present 
      as neonatal cholestasis, neurologic disease or fat-soluble-vitamin deficiencies. 
      There are nine known defects of bile acid synthesis, including oxysterol
      7alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, Delta(4)-3-oxosteroid-5beta-reductase deficiency, 
      3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency, cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (also known as sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency),
      alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency, and Zellweger syndrome (also known as
      cerebrohepatorenal syndrome). These diseases are characterized by a failure to
      produce normal bile acids and an accumulation of unusual bile acids and bile acid
      intermediaries. Individuals with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis generally
      present with the hallmark features of normal or low serum bile acid
      concentrations, normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase concentrations and the
      absence of pruritus. Failure to diagnose any of these conditions can result in
      liver failure or progressive chronic liver disease. If recognized early, many
      patients can have a remarkable clinical response to oral bile acid therapy.

PG  - 2063-73
LID - 10.1194/jlr.D800017-JLR200 [doi]
AB  - We have developed a highly sensitive and specific method for the analysis of
      serum sterol profiles. Sterols in 1 mul of dried serum were derivatized into
      picolinyl esters (3beta-picolinate) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. In
      addition to cholesterol, 19 cholesterol precursors, cholestanol, campesterol,
      sitosterol, and sitostanol were identified simultaneously. Quantitative analyses 
      for the picolinyl esters of 11 available sterols were performed, and detection
      limits were found to be less than 1 pg on-column. Reproducibilities and
      recoveries of 8 noncholesterol sterols were validated according to one-way layout
      and polynomial equation, respectively. The variances between sample preparations 
      and between measurements by this method were calculated to be 1.6% to 8.2% and
      2.5% to 16.5%, respectively. The recovery experiments were performed using 1 mul 
      aliquots of normal human serum spiked with 1 ng to 6 ng of sterols, and
      recoveries of the sterols ranged from 88.1% to 102.5% with a mean recovery of
      98.1%. The present method provides reliable and reproducible results for the
      identification and quantification of neutral sterols, especially in small volumes
      of blood samples, which is useful for serological diagnosis of inherited
      disorders in cholesterol metabolism and for noninvasive evaluation of cholesterol
      biosynthesis and absorption in humans.

      higher than normal. As causal therapy, ursodeoxycholic acid and statin drugs were
      prescribed to halt progression.

PG  - 839-42
LID - 10.1007/s00415-008-0729-6 [doi]
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an inherited autosomal recessive lipid storage 
      disease caused by a 27-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency, characterised clinically by
      tendon xanthomas, premature cataracts, chronic diarrhoea and progressive
      neurologic dysfunction. The disease is very uncommon and there are very few
      pathological descriptions. We report a 52-year-old male who presented with a
      neuropsychiatric disorder and cognitive decline. Despite treatment the patient
      developed optic atrophy, parkinsonism and dementia and died. The autopsy revealed
      a nonspecific brain and cerebellar atrophy. Under microscopic examination, lipid 
      crystal clefts, neuronal loss, demyelination, reactive astrocytosis and
      perivascular macrophages were found. These findings suggest the limited
      reversibility of the disease, and its poor prognosis, specially if treatment is
      not started early.

      metabolic disorder].
PG  - 632-6
AB  - In three young patients who presented with bilateral cataracts the cause proved
      to be an inherited metabolic disease. The first patient was a newborn aged 7
      weeks, in whom galactokinase deficiency was diagnosed. The second patient was a
      boy aged 8 years with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The third patient was a
      girl who was diagnosed with cataracts at the age of 3 months. At the age of 4
      years the diagnosis 'rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata' was established.
      Screening for metabolic disorders in all children with bilateral cataracts is
      essential, as in some disorders progressive and severe symptoms can be avoided
      with timely initiation of treatment. In addition, diagnosis allows for family
      studies and genetic counselling to take place. This may result in prevention of
      disease by early therapeutic intervention and prenatal screening.

AB  - The discovery of a leukoencephalopathy is a frequent situation in neurological
      practice and the diagnostic approach is often difficult given the numerous
      possible aetiologies, which include multiple acquired causes and genetic diseases
      including inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). It is now clear that IEMs can have 
      their clinical onset from early infancy until late adulthood. These diseases are 
      particularly important to recognize because specific treatments often exist. In
      this review, illustrated by personal observations, we give an overview of
      late-onset leukoencephalopathies caused by IEMs.

TI  - Noncholesterol sterols.
PG  - 5-101
AB  - Although most of us are more or less familiar with the term "cholesterol", the
      world of sterols is far more complicated and interesting. Apart from cholesterol,
      many non-cholesterol sterols can be found in human plasma and these sterols serve
      many important functions in human organism. They are either derived from
      endogenous biosynthesis of cholesterol or they come from dietary sources
      (phytosterols). The sole cholesterol molecule is used for keeping our cell
      membranes fit, for signalization purposes as well as a precursor for bile acids
      and steroid hormones. The compounds prior to cholesterol in its biosynthetic
      pathway were identified as vitamin D3 precursor, meiosis activating sterols and
      nowadays it seems that they could play a role in cholesterol homeostasis. The
      sterols from ingested vegetable sources, the phytosterols, are expelled from
      enterocytes and thus indirectly help our gut in coping with abundant cholesterol 
      in the lumen. Higher plants synthesize many phytosterols, but in marine
      organisms, we can find other innumerous sterol molecules. The diversity of sterol
      molecules produced and resistance of their tetracyclic core to enzymatic
      activities implies crucial importance of sterols during the ontogenesis of
      multicellular organisms. First oxygen appeared on the Earth app. 2.7 billion
      years ago and since that time, every new life form took the advantage of oxygen
      needed also for build-up of sterol molecules. The last decades changed our view
      to the sterol molecules on almost at all levels of their appearance in human
      body. In the gut, the absorption of sterols was proven to be protein dependent
      and the quest for the transporter was successful. The general concepts of
      intracellular homeostasis of cholesterol have been described including the
      covalent interaction unbelievable so far - cholesterol and a protein. The
      clinical importance of non-cholesterol sterols rises with the effort to discover 
      underlying facts about the causes of atherosclerosis. The compound in question,
      cholesterol, seems to be involved, but it sounds not to be crucial per se. The
      fact that the accumulation of phytosterols in sitosterolemia enhances the
      probability of early atherosclerosis onset further supports the hypothesis about 
      some sterol (or steroid) compound being responsible on the molecular level for
      triggering the pathobiochemical cascade of events leading to atherosclerosis.
      Understanding the processes taking place in the enterocyte during the absorption 
      of sterols resulted in synthesis of selective inhibitors at the level of sterol
      translocation into the enterocyte, sterol esterification and chylomicron packing,
      which are in different phases of clinical testing. The studies in the last part
      of the monograph represent the clinical potential of the analyses of
      non-cholesterol sterols. In well-defined groups, these analytes enables us to
      assess the changes in the homeostasis of cholesterol, which can be reflected in
      the concentration of total cholesterol. Furthermore, the high concentrations of
      some plasma sterols could point to the inborn errors of cholesterol biosynthesis 
      (Smith-Laemli-Opitz syndrome), transport (sitosterolemia) or metabolization
      (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis). Some issues concerning the research on the
      non-cholesterol sterols still remain unanswered - it is not known why some of the
      enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthesis (seladin-1, sterol D14 reductase) have
      other functions, qualitative aspects of sterol absorption are not satisfactorily 
      explained and exact reason for expulsion of phytosterols from human body is not
      clear. Nevertheless, the authors hope that the presented facts can broaden the
      reader's perspective about the area, which is usually hidden beneath the
      cholesterol molecule.

TI  - [Treatable hereditary neuro-metabolic diseases].
PG  - 884-96
AB  - Hereditary metabolic diseases may appear during adolescence or young adulthood,
      revealed by an apparently unexplained neurological or psychiatric disorder.
      Certain metabolic diseases respond to specific treatments and should be
      identified early, particularly in emergency situations where rapid introduction
      of a treatment can avoid fatal outcome or irreversible neurological damage. The
      main diseases leading to an acute neurological syndrome in the adult are urea
      cycle disorders, homocysteine metabolisms disorders and porphyria. More rarely,
      Wilson's disease, aminoacid diseases, organic aciduria, or pyruvate dehydrogenase
      deficiency, beta-oxidation disordes or biotin metabolism may be involved. Most
      emergency situations can be screen correctly with simple tests (serum ammonia,
      homocysteine, lactate, urinary prophyrines, acylcarnitine pattern, amino acid and
      organic acid chromatography). For chronic situations, the main treatable diseases
      are Wilson's disease, homocysteine, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Refsum's
      disease, vitamin E deficiency, Gaucher's disease, Fabry's disease, and
      neurotransmitter metabolism disorders. We present treatable metabolic disorders
      as a function of the different clinical situations observed in adults.

TI  - Effectors of rapid homeostatic responses of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol and
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.
PG  - 1445-55
AB  - The cholesterol content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the activity of
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) imbedded therein respond
      homeostatically within minutes to changes in the level of plasma membrane
      cholesterol. We have now examined the roles of sterol regulatory element-binding 
      protein (SREBP)-dependent gene expression, side chain oxysterol biosynthesis, and
      cholesterol precursors in the short term regulation of ER cholesterol levels and 
      HMGR activity. We found that SREBP-dependent gene expression is not required for 
      the response to changes in cell cholesterol of either the pool of ER cholesterol 
      or the rate of cholesterol esterification. It was also found that the acute
      proteolytic inactivation of HMGR triggered by cholesterol loading required the
      conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol. High levels of exogenous
      24,25-dihydrolanosterol drove the inactivation of HMGR; lanosterol did not.
      However, purging endogenous 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, lanosterol, and other
      biosynthetic sterol intermediates by treating cells with NB-598 did not greatly
      affect either the setting of their ER cholesterol pool or the inactivation of
      their HMGR. In summary, neither SREBP-regulated genes nor 27-hydroxycholesterol
      is involved in setting the ER cholesterol pool. On the other hand,
      27-hydroxycholesterol, rather than cholesterol itself or biosynthetic precursors 
      of cholesterol, stimulates the rapid inactivation of HMGR in response to high
      levels of cholesterol.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a case report.
PG  - 654-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare, autosomal recessive,
      inherited lipid storage disease characterized by accumulation of cholestanol and 
      cholesterol in most tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in the sterol
      27-hydroxylase gene, leading to a block in bile synthesis, with accumulation of
      substrates for this enzyme, including cholesterol, resulting in an increase in
      the conversion of cholesterol to cholestanol. CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented
      with gradually increasing bilateral ankle swelling. She had a history of
      bilateral cataracts and left-sided hemiparesis. She had mental retardation, with 
      a history of delayed milestone development. Her serum cholesterol levels were
      elevated. Aspiration of both ankle swellings revealed histiocytes and many
      foreign body giant cells. There were numerous rectangular to rhomboid crystals in
      the background. CONCLUSION: Very few articles are available on the cytologic
      features of tendinous xanthomas; hence we tried to highlight these features.

TI  - Mutational analysis of CYP27A1: assessment of 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol and
      25-hydroxylation of vitamin D.
PG  - 1248-55
AB  - The CYP27A1 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that modulates the acidic
      biosynthetic pathway for bile acids beginning with the 27-hydroxylation of
      cholesterol. CYP27A1 also 25-hydroxylates vitamin D(3). Gene mutations cause
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), an autosomal recessive disorder, and may
      cause 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and early-onset osteoporosis and fractures
      in affected patients. To examine the effects of mutations of CYP27A1 on vitamin D
      and cholesterol hydroxylating activity, recombinant CYP27A1 and mutant
      complementary DNAs produced by site-directed mutagenesis were stably expressed in
      either Escherichia coli or COS-1 cells. Activities of wild-type and mutant
      enzymes were determined with cholesterol, vitamin D(3), and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin
      D(3) (1alphaOHD(3)) as substrates. Of the 15 mutants tested, 11 expressed protein
      and 4 expressed little or no protein. Functional heme activity, estimated by
      reduced CO difference spectra at 450 nm, was absent in 12 mutants. When expressed
      in E. coli, 3 mutants, K226R, D321G, and P408S, each known to cause clinically
      CTX, showed modest decreases in reduced CO spectra peak and either no change or
      decreases of less than 50% in hydroxylation of cholesterol, vitamin D(3), and
      1alphaOHD(3) compared with wild type. When expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, 
      each of these mutants showed 25-hydroxylation activity for 1alphaOHD(3) as well
      as wild type. Thus, 3 mutants, K226R, D321G, and P408S, known to occur clinically
      with nonfunctioning mutants, hydroxylated cholesterol, vitamin D(3), and
      1alphaOHD(3). How they contribute to the pathogenesis of CTX despite being
      biologically active in vitro remains to be determined.

TI  - Psychiatric manifestations revealing inborn errors of metabolism in adolescents
      and adults.
PG  - 631-41
AB  - Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) may present in adolescence or adulthood as a
      psychiatric disorder. In some instances, an IEM is suspected because of
      informative family history or because psychiatric symptoms form part of a more
      diffuse clinical picture with systemic, cognitive or motor neurological signs.
      However, in some cases, psychiatric signs may be apparently isolated. We propose 
      a schematic classification of IEMs into three groups according to the type of
      psychiatric signs at onset. Group 1 represents emergencies, in which disorders
      can present with acute and recurrent attacks of confusion, sometimes misdiagnosed
      as acute psychosis. Diseases in this group include urea cycle defects,
      homocysteine remethylation defects and porphyrias. Group 2 includes diseases with
      chronic psychiatric symptoms arising in adolescence or adulthood. Catatonia,
      visual hallucinations, and aggravation with treatments are often observed. This
      group includes homocystinurias, Wilson disease, adrenoleukodystrophy and some
      lysosomal disorders. Group 3 is characterized by mild mental retardation and
      late-onset behavioural or personality changes. This includes homocystinurias,
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, nonketotic hyperglycinaemia, monoamine oxidase A 
      deficiency, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, creatine transporter 
      deficiency, and alpha and beta mannosidosis. Because specific treatments should
      be more effective at the 'psychiatric stage' before the occurrence of
      irreversible neurological lesions, clinicians should be aware of atypical
      psychiatric symptoms or subtle organic signs that are suggestive of an IEM. Here 
      we present an overview of IEMs potentially revealed by psychiatric problems in
      adolescence or adulthood and provide a diagnostic strategy to guide metabolic
      investigations.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: case report with evidence of oxidative stress.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid
      synthesis, characterized by mutation in the mitochondrial enzyme 27-hydroxylase
      that leads to an accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol. Characterized
      clinically by premature bilateral cataracts, slowly progressive neurological
      deterioration with dementia, cerebellar and brainstem signs, peripheral
      neuropathy, and seizures, the disease presents pathologically with lipid
      granulomata with foamy histiocytes and cholesterol clefts. Replacement therapy
      with chenodeoxycholic acid slows progression of the disease but does not reverse 
      neurological deficits. Here, we present the case of a 49-year-old woman diagnosed
      at autopsy with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, on the basis of bilateral
      Achilles tendon granulomas, and typical foamy histiocytic infiltration of the
      brain, most severe in the dentate nucleus, and a typical clinical presentation.
      To investigate the pathological manifestations of this disease further, we
      performed immunohistochemistry for N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)-lysine, an
      indicator of oxidative damage, and found strong labeling of cytoplasmic material 
      within histiocytes. In summary, this case of undiagnosed cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis during life emphasizes the need for a greater awareness of the
      disease, and early diagnosis and treatment. Further, the involvement of oxidative
      stress in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis indicates that combined therapy with
      chenodeoxycholic acid and antioxidants may improve clinical outcome.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Saudi Arabian family-genotyping and long-term
      follow-up.
PG  - 1113-8
AB  - A Saudi Arabian family is described in which there were 2 siblings with typical
      features of cerebral xanthomatosis CTX including premature cataracts, xanthomata 
      of the Achilles tendons, neuro-psychiatric disturbances, and atherosclerosis. The
      2 patients were homozygous for a point mutation in the mitochondrial
      27-hydroxylase gene CYP27A1, OMIM 606530 located in the splice site of intron 6, 
      where G was exchanged for A IVS6+1G>A. Their parents were cousins, 5 siblings
      were healthy, 2 were heterozygous for the mutation, and one showed the wild-type 
      genotype. The father was heterozygous for the mutation, while the other family
      members were not tested. The progress of the 2 CTX patients over 14 years is
      described; firstly when they were receiving treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid;
      when this medication was not available, and later when it was restored. A
      hereditary hyperlipidemia was also present in this family. It is suggested that
      when this occurs with CTX, a more serious illness results that merits more
      aggressive dual therapy.

TI  - [Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
PG  - 1463-6
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 43-year-old woman had since childhood suffered
      from progressive dementia. Gait ataxia and mild polyneuropathy were noted in the 
      neurological examination. She also had painful xanthomas of the achilles tendons.
      A bilateral cataract operation had been performed during adolescence.
      INVESTIGATIONS: An elevated concentration of cholestanol and a normal cholesterol
      level were found in the blood samples. The cerebral computed tomography revealed 
      slight cerebral atrophy, predominantly affecting the cerebellum.
      Neurophysiological tests detected a sensory polyneuropathy in the legs. In
      addition the electroencephalogram showed a generalized slowing of electrical
      activity. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Clinical findings and laboratory
      values indicated the diagnosis of a cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. After
      initiation of a drug therapy, based on a combination of an HMG-CoA-reductase
      inhibitor (simvastatin 20 mg/day) and a bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid (15
      mg/kg/day), further progression of the disease was prevented. CONCLUSION: The
      diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is easily made in patients presenting
      all clinical symptoms expected in the disease. However, up to 30% of the patients
      do not show severe xanthomas. Especially in early stages of the disease the
      diagnosis may be difficult. Treatment can be efficacious and should be started as
      early as possible to prevent irreversible damage, particularly in the nervous
      system.

TI  - Rifampicin-induced CYP3A4 activation in CTX patients cannot replace
      chenodeoxycholic acid treatment.
PG  - 839-44
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with
      cholestanol accumulation resulting from mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase
      gene (CYP27A). Conventional treatment includes chenodeoxycholic acid and HMG-CoA 
      reductase inhibitors. Mice with disrupted Cyp27A (Cyp27 KO) do not show elevated 
      cholestanol levels nor develop CTX manifestations. This phenomenon was proposed
      to be due to murine CYP3A overexpression leading to an alternative pathway for
      degradation of bile alcohols including cholestanol. Our objective was to examine 
      the influence of CYP3A4 induction on cholestanol elimination in CTX patients.
      Rifampicin (600 mg/day x 7 days), known to induce the PXR, and thereby to
      increase CYP3A activity, was used. The degree of CYP3A4 induction was assessed by
      comparing midazolam pharmacokinetics before and after rifampicin treatment.
      Cholestanol levels and cholestanol/cholesterol ratios were assayed during the
      experimental period and compared to a 3 weeks period without treatment. The
      results show that despite 60% increase in CYP3A4 activity following rifampicin
      treatment, there is no significant change in cholestanol levels. We conclude that
      up-regulated expression of CYP3A affects cholestanol elimination in mice
      differently as compared to its effect in CTX patients. Therefore, CYP3A4 inducers
      cannot replace chenodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of CTX.

TI  - Unique patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Evidence for presence of a
      defect in a gene that is not identical to sterol 27-hydroxylase.
PG  - 504-10
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder
      believed to be exclusively caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene coding for the
      enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. Common findings in CTX are tendon xanthomas,
      cataracts and progressive neurological dysfunction. Here, we characterize an
      adult female patient with tendon xanthomas and classic biochemical findings of
      CTX (i.e. high levels of bile alcohols and cholestanol and extremely low levels
      of 27-hydroxycholesterol in plasma). Additionally, sterol 27-hydroxylase activity
      in cultured monocyte-derived macrophages from this patient was <5% of normal.
      Sequencing the CYP27A1 gene uncovered that the patient is heterozygous for two
      previously undescribed base substitutions in exon 8, C478A and C479A, which are
      expected to affect the haeme-binding domain of the enzyme. When expressed in
      HEK293 cells, the corresponding protein had only 8% of normal enzymatic activity.
      No other mutation was found in the open reading frame of the CYP27A1 gene,
      intron-exon boundaries or in the 5'-untranslated region up to 5000 bp distal to
      the translational start site. Sequencing mRNA isolated from leucocytes from the
      patient revealed a 1 : 1 ratio of mutated and nonmutated species, with total mRNA
      levels that were not significantly different from the controls. It is concluded
      that the patient is heterozygous for two mutations affecting one allele of the
      CYP27A1 gene and with at least one additional yet undefined gene that is of
      critical importance for the activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase.

TI  - High-throughput urine screening for Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis using negative electrospray tandem mass
      spectrometry.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis 
      (CTX) are disorders affecting cholesterol metabolism. Currently, diagnosis relies
      on clinical recognition and specific and complex biochemical testing. METHODS: A 
      rapid, high-throughput urine test, suitable for mass screening for these two
      disorders, was developed using flow injection negative electrospray tandem mass
      spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring. Cholestane-pentol glucuronide, a 
      known marker for CTX, was measured and a steroid sulfate with a proposed
      keto-pregnadien-diol structure was identified and measured for SLOS. Measurement 
      of the two markers was readily incorporated into an existing tandem mass
      spectrometry method for diagnosing inborn errors of amino and organic acid
      metabolism. RESULTS: Levels in affected patients were well separated from 1738
      controls, ranging from 6.7 to 100 times the 99.7th percentile of controls in SLOS
      patients (n=3) and 7.3 to 24 times the 99.7th percentile of controls in CTX
      patients (n=4). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of testing for SLOS and CTX to a
      routine tandem mass spectrometry urine screening program simplifies the diagnosis
      of these two disorders and further extends the range of inborn errors of
      metabolism detected by this technique.

TI  - On the mechanism of cerebral accumulation of cholestanol in patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1167-74
AB  - The most serious consequence of sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency in humans
      [cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX)] is the development of
      cholestanol-containing brain xanthomas. The cholestanol in the brain may be
      derived from the circulation or from 7alpha-hydroxylated intermediates in bile
      acid synthesis, present at 50- to 250-fold increased levels in plasma. Here, we
      demonstrate a transfer of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one across cultured
      porcine brain endothelial cells (a model for the blood-brain barrier) that is
      approximately 100-fold more efficient than the transfer of cholestanol.
      Furthermore, there was an efficient conversion of
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to cholestanol in cultured neuronal and glial
      cells as well as in monocyte-derived macrophages of human origin. It is concluded
      that the continuous intracellular production of cholestanol from a bile acid
      precursor capable of rapidly passing biomembranes, including the blood-brain
      barrier, is likely to be of major importance for the accumulation of cholestanol 
      in patients with CTX. Such a mechanism also fits well with the observation that
      treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, which normalizes the level of the bile acid
      precursor, results in a reduction of cholestanol-containing xanthomas even in the
      brain.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare lipid storage disorder due tocaused by
      an autosomal recessive inherited defect of the hepatic mitochondrial sterol 27
      hydroxylase. It's characterized by accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in
      many tissues, in particular tendons and brain, with tendon xanthomas, juvenile
      cataracts, and neurological abnormalities. MR imaging showed typical bilateral
      and symmetrical involvement of the dentate nuclei. Early and long- term treatment
      may improve neurologic function. The authors present a case of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis and describe ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic

TI  - Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 47
AB  - Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) are a heterogeneous group of rare
      neurological disorders involving both central and peripheral nervous system, and 
      in some case other systems and organs, and characterized by degeneration or
      abnormal development of cerebellum and spinal cord, autosomal recessive
      inheritance and, in most cases, early onset occurring before the age of 20 years.
      This group encompasses a large number of rare diseases, the most frequent in
      Caucasian population being Friedreich ataxia (estimated prevalence 2-4/100,000), 
      ataxia-telangiectasia (1-2.5/100,000) and early onset cerebellar ataxia with
      retained tendon reflexes (1/100,000). Other forms ARCA are much less common.
      Based on clinicogenetic criteria, five main types ARCA can be distinguished:
      congenital ataxias (developmental disorder), ataxias associated with metabolic
      disorders, ataxias with a DNA repair defect, degenerative ataxias, and ataxia
      associated with other features. These diseases are due to mutations in specific
      genes, some of which have been identified, such as frataxin in Friedreich ataxia,
      alpha-tocopherol transfer protein in ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED),
      aprataxin in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA1), and senataxin in ataxia with 
      oculomotor apraxia (AOA2). Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by ancillary tests
      such as neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, scanning), electrophysiological
      examination, and mutation analysis when the causative gene is identified. Correct
      clinical and genetic diagnosis is important for appropriate genetic counseling
      and prognosis and, in some instances, pharmacological treatment. Due to autosomal
      recessive inheritance, previous familial history of affected individuals is
      unlikely. For most ARCA there is no specific drug treatment except for coenzyme
      Q10 deficiency and abetalipoproteinemia.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: need for early diagnosis.
PG  - 364-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage
      disease characterized by widespread tissue deposition of two neutral sterols,
      cholestanol and cholesterol, resulting in tendinous xanthomas, juvenile
      cataracts, progressive neurological defects and premature death from
      arteriosclerosis. The primary biochemical defect is deficiency of hepatic
      mitochondrial enzyme sterol-27-hydroxylase which catalyses the hydroxylation of
      cholestanol (5-alpha dehydro derivative of cholesterol) and this deficiency
      decreases bile acid synthesis. Substantial elevation of serum cholestanol and
      urinary bile alcohols with low to normal plasma cholesterol concentration
      establishes the diagnosis. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is exceptionally rare
      in the Indian population. We are reporting a woman with this rare disorder, who
      was on antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs for a prolonged period and whose
      original condition went undiagnosed. She presented with xanthomas on the Achilles
      tendons and the upper end of tibia. She was mentally subnormal and her serum
      cholestanol level was raised. Her younger sister too was severely affected by
      this disorder. Early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid is known to prevent
      disease progression.

TI  - Cholestanol metabolism in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis:
      absorption, turnover, and tissue deposition.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - To study the metabolism of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX), we measured the cholestanol absorption, the cholesterol and 
      cholestanol turnover, and the tissue content of sterols in two patients.
      Cholestanol absorption was approximately 5.0%. The rapid exchangeable pool of
      cholestanol was 233 mg, and the total exchangeable pool was 752 mg. The
      production rate of cholestanol in pool A was 39 mg/day. [4-14C]cholestanol was
      detected in the xanthomas, but neither [4-14C]cholestanol nor [4-14C]cholesterol 
      was detected in peripheral nerves biopsied at 49 and 97 days after
      [4-14C]cholesterol given intravenously. Of the 18 tissues analyzed at biopsy and 
      autopsy, the cholestanol content varied from 0.09 mg/g in psoas muscle to 76 mg/g
      in a cerebellar xanthoma. With the assumption that the cholestanol-to-cholesterol
      ratio is 1.0, the relative cholestanol-to-cholesterol ratio varied from 1.0 in
      plasma and liver to 30.0 in the cerebellar xanthoma; cholestanol was especially
      high in nerve tissue. Our data indicate that CTX patients absorb cholestanol from
      the diet. They have a higher than normal cholestanol production rate. Cholestanol
      was derived from cholesterol. In CTX patients, the blood-brain barrier was intact
      to the passage of [4-14C]cholesterol and [4-14C]cholestanol. The deposition of
      large amounts of cholestanol (up to 30% of total sterols in cerebellum) in nerve 
      tissues must have an important role in the neurological symptoms in CTX patients.
      In view of the intact blood-brain barrier, several other explanations for the
      large amounts of cholestanol in the brain were postulated.

AB  - A 22 years female who was diagnosed as having cholestseatoma of right ear was
      referred to us for medical fitness. On examination she incidentally had evidence 
      of tuberous and tendon xanthomas. She was found to have hypercholesterolemia. On 
      mastoid exploration a yellowish groomous mass was seen which was surrounded by
      foamy macrophages, suggestive of 'mastoid xanthoma'. The purpose of this case

TI  - Clinical and molecular diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with a review 
      of the mutations in the CYP27A1 gene.
PG  - 143-9
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to
      defective activity of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. In 1991,
      sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A1) was localised on the long arm of chromosome 
      2 [1]. Clinical characteristics of CTX are diarrhoea, cataracts, tendon xanthomas
      and neurological manifestations including dementia, psychiatric disturbances,
      pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, and seizures. More than 300 patients with CTX 
      have been reported to date worldwide and about 50 different mutations identified 
      in the CYP27A1 gene. Almost all mutations lead to the absence or inactive form of
      the sterol 27-hydroxylase. In this review, according with the aims of this
      section of the journal, we describe the different pathogenetic mutations in the
      CYP27A1 gene and the main clinical and pathogenetic aspects that may help
      clinical neurologists in the diagnosis of CTX.

      soft-tissue swellings of both Achilles tendons. MRI demonstrated fusiform
      enlargement involving the Achilles tendons bilaterally. The tendons returned
      heterogeneous signal intensity characterised by a diffuse reticulated appearance.
      The right tendon mass was treated with a wide marginal excision and Achilles
      tendon reconstruction. The histology confirmed Achilles tendon xanthoma. Further 
      metabolic investigation revealed the patient to have a rare autosomal recessive
      condition called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Her brother was also
      affected. CTX is easily treatable if diagnosed early, and should be suspected in 
      patients presenting with bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomas and normal plasma
      lipid levels.

TI  - Diagnosing inborn errors of lipid metabolism with proton nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy.
PG  - 1395-405
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many severe diseases are caused by defects in lipid metabolism. As a 
      result, patients often accumulate unusual lipids in their blood and tissues, and 
      proper identification of these lipids is essential for correct diagnosis. In this
      study, we investigated the potential use of proton nuclear magnetic resonance
      (1H-NMR) spectroscopy to simultaneously identify and quantify (un)usual lipids
      present in the blood of patients with different inborn errors of lipid
      metabolism. METHODS: We extracted blood plasma or serum lipids in
      chloroform-methanol (2:1 by volume). After addition of the nonvolatile chemical
      shift and concentration reference compound octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, we
      performed 1H-NMR measurements on a 500-MHz spectrometer. Assignments were based
      on the literature, computer simulations, and reference spectra of relevant
      authentic standards. RESULTS: Spectra of normal plasma samples allowed the
      identification of 9 lipid species. We found good correlation between conventional
      methods and 1H-NMR for cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. We also
      investigated 4 inborn errors of lipid metabolism (3 in sterol metabolism and 1 in
      fatty acid metabolism). NMR analysis led to a correct diagnosis for all 4
      diseases, whereas the concentration of the diagnostic metabolite could be
      determined for 3. CONCLUSIONS: 1H-NMR spectroscopy of blood plasma or serum lipid
      extracts can be used to accurately identify and quantify lipids. The method can
      also identify unusual lipids in the blood of patients with inborn errors of lipid
      metabolism. This technique may therefore be applicable in clinical diagnosis and 
      follow-up.

TI  - Distinct binding of cholesterol and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 
      to cytochrome P450 27A1: evidence from modeling and site-directed mutagenesis
      studies.
PG  - 4396-404
AB  - Cytochrome P450 27A1 (P450 27A1 or CYP27A1) is an important enzyme that
      participates in different pathways of cholesterol degradation as well as in the
      activation of vitamin D(3). Several approaches were utilized to investigate how
      two physiological substrates, cholesterol and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol, interact with CYP27A1. The enzyme
      active site was first probed spectrally by assessing binding of the two
      substrates and five substrate analogues followed by computer modeling and
      site-directed mutagenesis. The computer models suggest that the spatial positions
      and orientations of cholesterol and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 
      are different in the enzyme active site. As a result, some of the active site
      residues interact with both substrates, although they are situated differently
      relative to each steroid, and some residues bind only one substrate. Mutation of 
      the overlapping substrate-contact residues (W100, H103, T110, M301C, V367, I481, 
      and V482) affected CYP27A1 binding and enzyme activity in a substrate-dependent
      manner and allowed identification of several important side chains. T110 is
      proposed to interact with the 12alpha-hydroxyl of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol, whereas V367 seems to be crucial
      for correct positioning of the cholesterol C26 methyl group and for
      regioselective hydroxylation of this substrate. Distinct binding of the CYP27A1
      substrates may provide insight into why phenotypic manifestations of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a disease associated with CYP27A1 deficiency, are
      so diverse.

TI  - Could steroids mask the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis?
PG  - 83-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of
      bile acid synthesis, caused by impaired hydroxylation of cholesterol side chains 
      due to deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1),
      leading to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in brain and other
      tissues. Elevated plasma cholestanol serves as a key marker for the clinical
      diagnosis of CTX. In the present report we describe a young man with CTX who was 
      on high dose steroids for a misdiagnosed chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polyneuropathy (CIDP) and had normal level of serum cholestanol. When steroids
      were discontinued, markedly elevated serum cholestanol was measured concomitant
      with marked clinical worsening. This observation may imply that steroids can
      lower plasma cholestanol, possibly by directly inducing residual CYP27A1 activity
      or by inducing alternative pathways for cholestanol elimination.

TI  - New insights into the pathological mechanisms of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
      in the Taiwanese using genomic and proteomic tools.
PG  - 1029-37
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid-storage
      disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase.
      Genetic analysis utilizing SSCP and direct DNA sequencing identified a new
      mutation. One base-pair of cytosine was deleted at codon 326 on exon 2 of CYP27
      in all CTX patients while their father was heterozygotic. This novel point
      deletion predicts a frameshift in mRNA (Pro(102) -->Leu) and results in the
      appearance of a premature termination codon (TGA) to substitute for Val(106)
      (GTG). To characterize the pathological mechanism of CTX patients, the protein
      profiles of serum and leukocytes extracted from these subjects were presented by 
      means of proteomic technologies including 2-DE and MALDI-TOF analysis. According 
      to the results, the amount of vinculin, ABP-280, talin and vimentin in leukocytes
      of CTX patients had changed significantly, reflecting the changes in membrane
      dynamics concerning cholestanol accumulation. The expression of target proteins
      in CTX patients and control was further verified by western blotting which
      indicated the same tendency as 2-DE data. This is the first paper to integrate
      both genomic and proteomic concepts for analyzing the possible mechanism of CTX
      and provides more information for related study in the future.

PG  - 276-83
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomathosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal-recessively transmitted
      disease of the lipid storage system with an array of general and neurological
      symptoms, based on the pathological storage of cholestanol and cholesterol. The
      histologic manifestations are foamy cell granulomata and cholesterol crystals
      within various tissues, associated with a loss of both nerve cells and
      demyelination inside the CNS. We present a case of CTX with clinical progression 
      as well as the pathomorphologic autopsy findings. The CNS affection in our case
      will be demonstrated and the pathogenesis be discussed. Medical treatment of CTX 
      is possible but with variable success. In the case shown, the patient profited
      only marginally from a long-term application of chenodeoxycholic acid.

TI  - Unusual cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with fronto-temporal dementia phenotype.
PG  - 114-7
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage
      disease caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 27-sterol hydroxylase 
      (CYP27). We report a 53-year-old man, with an unusual phenotype of CTX. He had
      xanthomas since adolescence. He had no mental retardation and developed at 44
      years a progressive neuropsychiatric phenotype, suggestive of fronto-temporal
      dementia according to clinical Neary criteria. Cataract and ataxia were absent.
      Cerebral MRI revealed diffuse hyperintense T2 abnormalities in the supratentorial
      white matter without cerebellar atrophy or lesions, while Technetium-99m-ECD
      brain SPECT revealed a severe cerebellar hypoperfusion. Serum cholestanol level
      was elevated with excessive urinary bile alcohols excretion. Mutation analysis
      revealed that he was compound heterozygous for two mutations in the CYP27A1 gene:
      1016 C > T (exon 5) on one allele and a novel mutation, 1435C > G (exon 8) on the
      other allele. A follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the effects of
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and simvastatin treatment during 3 years. In spite
      of this treatment, cognitive functions declined but no other signs of
      neurological deterioration appeared.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: possible higher prevalence than previously
      recognized.
PG  - 1459-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare but treatable
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP27) deficiency.
      OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical features and results of genetic analysis in a
      family with CTX. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital. Subjects A
      54-year-old woman with CTX, her family members, and 115 white control subjects.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance
      imaging of the brain in the affected subject; results of mutation analysis of the
      CYP27 coding sequence in the patient, her parents, and the control subjects.
      RESULTS: The proband and her affected sibling had classic features of CTX,
      including presenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, diarrhea, and a complex
      neurodegenerative disorder. They were somewhat atypical, however, because their
      cataracts were congenital, cognitive impairment had been noted in childhood, and 
      the white matter involvement was more severe than usual. The proband was shown to
      be homozygous for CYP27 mutation R362C. Similar analysis of 115 control subjects 
      identified 1 subject who was a heterozygous carrier for this same CYP27 mutation.
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CTX due to CYP27 mutation R362C alone is
      approximately 1 per 50,000 among white individuals. Although the disorder is
      rare, this incidence is substantially greater than previously recognized. Greater
      awareness of CTX is important because specific treatment is available.

TI  - Mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene associated with fatal cholestasis in
      infancy.
PG  - 481-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are rare but potentially
      treatable causes of neonatal cholestasis. We here present a cholestatic infant
      with an ongoing cytomegalovirus infection who despite intensive treatment died of
      severe liver disease at 4 months of age. METHODS: The urinary steroids were
      investigated by electrospray mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass
      spectrometry. Oxysterols in plasma were analysed by isotope dilution mass
      spectrometry. Mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene were detected by PCR.
      RESULTS: Glucuronidated bile alcohols, which are known to be excreted by patients
      with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were detected in the urine. Analysis of
      plasma revealed markedly reduced levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol. Mutation
      analysis showed the presence of a stop codon in exon 7, confirming the diagnosis 
      of CTX, a rare disease not previously diagnosed in Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal and
      neonatal deaths among siblings of patients with CTX have been reported previously
      and the present case supports the contention that reduced activity of the sterol 
      27-hydroxylase may predispose to the development of neonatal cholestasis. The
      associated viral infection may have further precipitated the liver disease. Since
      CTX, like other inborn errors of bile acid synthesis may be treated with bile
      acids an early diagnosis is essential. Thus, the analysis of urine by
      electrospray mass spectrometry is highly recommended in the investigation of
      patients with neonatal cholestasis.

TI  - Isotopomer spectral analysis of intermediates of cholesterol synthesis in
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 335-44
AB  - Four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and 2 healthy controls
      received a constant proximal intraduodenal infusion of 1- 13 C-acetate as a
      stable-isotope-labeled marker of sterol synthesis. One patient was treated with
      pravastatin (20 mg twice daily) and another patient with chenodeoxycholic acid
      (250 mg tid). Every hour, venous blood and duodenal samples were obtained.
      Stable-isotope enrichment of neutral and polar sterols in serum and bile was
      assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Isotopomer spectral analysis
      was performed on cholesterol, lathosterol, Delta-8-cholesterol, methylsterol, and
      lanosterol. Stable-isotope labeling of cholestanol, bile acids, and bile alcohols
      was analyzed by assessing the change over time of the ratio of M + 3 to M + 0.
      Eleven hours after marker infusion, we found up to 50% newly synthesized
      lathosterol in serum and up to 80% in bile, with similar results for other
      cholesterol precursors. In cholesterol, stable-isotope labeling could be
      demonstrated in all study subjects with a more prominent labeling in bile than in
      serum. No stable-isotope labeling was detected in cholestanol. Only minor
      stable-isotope incorporation was detectable in polar sterols in some subjects.
      Therapy with pravastatin did not have any effect on fractional or absolute
      synthesis rates or on the concentrations of cholestanol or cholesterol precursors
      compared to untreated patients with CTX. In contrast, therapy with
      chenodeoxycholic acid markedly lowered the concentrations of cholestanol and
      cholesterol precursors, led to a disappearance of bile alcohols, and reduced
      absolute synthesis rates of lathosterol. Isotopomer spectral analysis proved to
      be a powerful method to assess the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol precursors
      in patients with CTX. Higher fractional synthesis in bile than in serum may be
      due to the size of the pools in bile vs serum. Cholestanol exhibits no marker
      uptake and is therefore probably synthesized from preformed cholesterol. Biliary 
      cholesterol secretion in patients with CTX is decreased compared to healthy
      controls.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: report of two Brazilian brothers.
PG  - 1085-9
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a treatable rare autossomal recessive disease
      characterized by lipid storage secondary to a sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency in
      the formation of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids. We describe two Brazilian
      brothers with cognitive impairement and chronic diarrhea. One of them also
      presents bilateral cataracts. Neurological findings were progressive walking
      deficit, limb ataxia and pyramidal signs. Both patients had bilateral Achilles
      tendon xanthomata. Magnetic resonance image showed signal alterations in
      cerebellar hemispheres. We describe these cases with molecular genetic analysis
      confirming diagnosis and comparing with previous literature. The CYP27A1 gene
      study showed a C1187T mutation on exon 6.

TI  - Sitosterolemia--a rare disease. Are elevated plant sterols an additional risk
      factor?
PG  - 921-8
AB  - Elevated plasma plant sterol concentrations, xanthomatosis, and accelerated-often
      fatal-atherosclerosis at young age are the major findings in patients with
      homozygous sitosterolemia. A defect in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 co-transporter gene
      locus (STSL) causes an increased intestinal absorption and a decreased biliary
      elimination of all sterols, plant sterols as well as cholesterol, leading to a 50
      to 200-fold increase in plasma plant sterol concentrations. A few recent
      publications indicate that even moderately elevated plasma plant sterol levels
      might be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. This raises the
      question whether plant sterols themselves might be atherogenic or whether
      elevated plasma levels are a marker for a decreased ABCG5/G8 transporter activity
      which itself causes an increased risk for atherosclerosis. However, current data 
      are too few to conclude that elevated plant sterol concentrations in plasma are
      an additional risk factor for coronary heart disease. But especially young
      patients suffering from xanthomatosis and/or atherosclerotic diseases with only
      mildly or moderately elevated plasma cholesterol should be screened for
      sitosterolemia by measurement of plasma plant sterol levels.

TI  - Disrupted coordinate regulation of farnesoid X receptor target genes in a patient
      with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) deficiency,
      is associated with markedly reduced chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the most
      powerful activating ligand for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). We investigated the
      effects of reduced CDCA on FXR target genes in humans. Liver specimens from an
      untreated CTX patient and 10 control subjects were studied. In the patient,
      hepatic CDCA concentration was markedly reduced but the bile alcohol level
      exceeded CDCA levels in control subjects (73.5 vs. 37.8 +/- 6.2 nmol/g liver).
      Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting
      polypeptide (NTCP) were upregulated 84- and 8-fold, respectively. However, small 
      heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump were normally expressed.
      Marked CYP7A1 induction with normal SHP expression was not explained by the
      regulation of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) or pregnane X receptor. However, 
      another nuclear receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), was
      induced 2.9-fold in CTX, which was associated with enhanced mRNA levels of
      HNF4alpha target genes, CYP7A1, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
      12alpha-hydroxylase, CYP27A1, and NTCP. In conclusion, the coordinate regulation 
      of FXR target genes was lost in CTX. The mechanism of the disruption may be
      explained by a normally stimulated FXR pathway attributable to markedly increased
      bile alcohols with activation of HNF4alpha caused by reduced bile acids in CTX
      liver.

      simvastatin and LDL apheresis.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - The concentrations of serum cholesterol, cholestanol and non-cholesterol sterols 
      were measured in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis under different
      therapeutic regimens. During treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (750
      mg/day) plus simvastatin (20 mg/day) for two years cholesterol and cholestanol
      concentrations averaged 188+/-10 mg/dl and 0.54+/-0.03 mg/dl. Thereafter
      treatment with simvastatin was discontinued. During treatment with low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis plus CDCA for 33 weeks, cholestanol concentrations
      reached almost normal levels (0.48+/-0.03 mg/dl immediately before and
      0.32+/-0.02 mg/dl directly after LDL-apheresis, n=6). A further reduction of
      cholesterol and cholestanol was achieved by addition of simvastatin (20 mg/day). 
      Cholesterol and cholestanol concentrations before and after LDL-apheresis during 
      this treatment period averaged 122+/-4 mg/dl and 55+/-10 mg/dl, and 0.42+/-0.02
      mg/dl and 0.18+/-0.06 mg/dl, respectively. Despite the consistent reduction of
      cholestanol to normal or even subnormal levels, a definite improvement of
      clinical symptoms was not noted. Our results suggest caution in the recourse to
      an aggressive cholestanol lowering therapy.

TI  - Role of CYP27A in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - The CYP27A gene encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme, sterol
      27-hydroxylase, that is expressed in many different tissues and plays an
      important role in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. In humans, CYP27A
      deficiency leads to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. To gain insight into the
      roles of CYP27A in the regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, cyp27A
      gene knockout heterozygous, homozygous, and wild-type littermate mice were
      studied. In contrast to homozygotes, heterozygotes had increased body weight and 
      were mildly hypercholesterolemic, with increased numbers of lipoprotein particles
      in the low density lipoprotein size range. Cyp7A expression was not increased in 
      heterozygotes but was in homozygotes, suggesting that parts of the homozygous
      phenotype are secondary to increased cyp7A expression and activity. Homozygotes
      exhibited pronounced hepatomegaly and dysregulation in hepatic cholesterol, bile 
      acid, and fatty acid metabolism. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis and synthesis of
      bile acid intermediates were increased; however, side chain cleavage was
      impaired, leading to decreased bile salt concentrations in gallbladder bile.
      Expression of Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, the major sinusoidal
      bile salt transporter, was increased, and that of bile salt export pump, the
      major canalicular bile salt transporter, was decreased. Gender played a modifying
      role in the homozygous response to cyp27A deficiency, with females being
      generally more severely affected. Thus, both cyp27A genotype and gender affected 
      the regulation of hepatic bile acid, cholesterol, and fatty acid metabolism.

TI  - Oxysteroids: a new class of steroids with autocrine and paracrine functions.
PG  - 393-7
AB  - Oxysteroids are a new classification for sterol intermediates in cholesterol
      synthesis that undergo enzyme-catalyzed stereo-specific 25R,26-hydroxylation and 
      thus bypass cholesterol as the expected end-product. Recently, they were
      identified in micromolar amounts in the plasma of patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz
      syndrome (SLOS). An additional three oxysteroids, the 25,26-hydroxy derivatives
      of lanosterol, zymosterol, and desmosterol, respectively, were generated in vitro
      by CYP27A1-transfected bacteria. As there are 19 steps between cholesterol and
      lanosterol, the first post-squalene sterol, a potentially large class of
      oxysteroids exists. Limited studies of 25r,26-7-dehydrocholesterol indicate a
      traditional role as a ligand for nuclear receptors, but complete evaluation of
      oxysteroids for novel biologic activities is lacking. Currently, the lack of
      authentic oxysteroid standards limits both their detection in biologic fluids and
      evaluation of their biologic effects.

TI  - Enhanced susceptibility of LDL to oxidative modification in a CTX patient:- role 
      of chenodeoxycholic acid in xanthoma formation.
PG  - 167-72
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familial sterol storage disease,
      causing multiple xanthomas in tendons and the brain. The underlying biochemical
      defect is a lack of the hepatic mitochondrial cholesterol 27-hydroxylase involved
      in the normal biosynthesis of bile acid, resulting in reduced biosynthesis of
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). It has been reported that administration of CDCA to
      CTX patients improves neurological disorders and xanthomas of the Achilles
      tendon. The present study investigated the effect of CDCA on the mechanism of
      cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, the major cells in xanthoma. The LDL
      from the patients in this study was significantly more susceptible to oxidative
      modification than normal LDL, and supplement therapy with CDCA resulted in an
      improvement in the susceptibility to oxidative modification. In the incubation of
      CDCA with plasma, 13% of the CDCA added to serum was recovered in the LDL
      fraction. In addition, supplementation with CDCA enhanced cholesteryl ester
      transfer protein (CETP) activity and reduced high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol
      levels in the plasma. This evidence suggests that the multiple xanthomas observed
      in CTX may be induced by increased oxidized LDL and the low activity of CETP,
      both of which are caused by a lack of CDCA.

TI  - Coronary heart disease in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 680-3
AB  - Coronary heart disease is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of death in
      developed countries. Most cases are due to the cluster of classical risk factors,
      such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia. However, a few 
      patients develop severe and premature arteriosclerosis in spite of absence of
      common risk factors. Here, we present the clinical, analytical and molecular
      features of a 36-years-old man who died from advanced ischaemic heart disease as 
      a result of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare condition characterized 
      by elevation in plasma and most tissues of cholestanol and where neurological
      impairment is the hallmark of this disease. We discuss the relevance of heart
      disease and the mechanism leading to accelerate arteriosclerosis is CTX.

TI  - Hydrophilic 7 beta-hydroxy bile acids, lovastatin, and cholestyramine are
      ineffective in the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 556-62
AB  - We compared the effect of treatments with hydrophilic bile acids (ursodeoxycholic
      and ursocholic acids), cholestyramine, and lovastatin versus chenodeoxycholic
      acid in 4 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Bile acids and bile
      alcohols in plasma, bile, and urine before and after treatment were quantitated
      by gas-liquid chromatography. Untreated, all patients showed abnormal biliary
      bile acid composition: cholic acid (72.7%) and chenodeoxycholic acid (6.2%), and 
      polyhydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols (10.0%), and elevated plasma cholestanol
      levels. Treatment with hydrophobic chenodeoxycholic acid inhibited abnormal bile 
      acid synthesis (virtual disappearance of C(27)-bile alcohols from plasma, bile,
      and urine and marked reduction of plasma cholestanol levels). Hydrophilic
      ursodeoxycholic and ursocholic acids did not inhibit abnormal bile acid
      synthesis, while cholestyramine increased abnormal bile acid synthesis (continued
      increased formation of polyhydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols and further elevation
      of plasma cholestanol levels). Lovastatin did not affect abnormal bile acid
      synthesis or reduce plasma cholestanol levels. The results demonstrate that
      impaired side-chain oxidation in bile acid synthesis due to mutations of Cyp27
      results in increased formation of polyhydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols and
      cholestanol in CTX. Hydrophobic chenodeoxycholic acid, but not cholestyramine,
      lovastatin, or hydrophilic 7beta-hydroxy acids, inhibited the abnormal synthetic 
      pathway. The role of chenodeoxycholic acid in downregulating abnormal bile acid
      synthesis in CTX is emphasized.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical course, genotypes and metabolic
      backgrounds.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic
      disease. It has been reported in more than 200 people worldwide. This review
      covers the epidemiologic, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the
      disease, its clinical symptoms and treatment. A search of MEDLINE, using the
      keywords cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, brain xanthoma, tendon xanthoma,
      cholestanol, cholesterol and bile alcohol for articles covering clinical
      manifestations, laboratory findings, pathology, molecular defects and treatment
      of CTX, revealed 175 patients with documented CTX. Of these patients, 56% were
      female. The incidence of tendon xanthomas was 71%, cataracts 92%, low
      intelligence 81% and other neurologic symptoms 100%. Several genetic studies have
      revealed mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene, resulting in markedly
      diminished activity of the enzyme in CTX patients. This genetic defect is
      associated with elevated plasma cholestanol levels and consequently its
      accumulation in the brain, lens, tendons and other tissues. The disease can be
      treated by the administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, a cost-effective therapy 
      that will considerably reduce the socioeconomic burden of treating patients with 
      CTX. The mechanism of cholestanol accumulation in affected tissues and its
      pathogenesis are undefined and therefore warrant further investigation.

AB  - We reported a Hong Kong Chinese proband with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis in
      which a novel acceptor splicing site mutation (IVS6-1G>T) was identified. Family 
      screening revealed the same mutation in his elder brother and the youngest
      sister. All the three affected siblings were compound heterozygous for IVS6-1G>T 
      and a known missense mutation R372Q (GenBank Accession No. M62401). Significant
      phenotypic variation was noted among them that the youngest sister was still
      symptom-free at the time of writing.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: neuroimaging findings in two siblings from an
      Indian family.
PG  - 401-3
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is exceptionally rare in the Indian
      population. We present and discuss the clinical, radiological and histopathologic
      findings in 2 siblings with CTX. Both the patients had juvenile cataract, mental 
      retardation and marked cerebellar ataxia. The Achilles tendon swelling was
      present in only 1 patient (Case 2). MR imaging showed typical bilateral and
      symmetrical involvement of the dentate nuclei, inferior olives, brainstem and
      cerebellar hemispheric white matter. Although the diagnosis of CTX was made in
      the 3rd decade in both our cases, early diagnosis is possible if neuroimaging is 
      done in the early course of the disease.

AB  - The effects of combined treatment with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis,
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA)
      reductase inhibitor were studied in 2 patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis. Patient 1 was initially treated with LDL-apheresis alone: serum
      cholestanol levels decreased by 50% after each apheresis, but returned to their
      initial levels within 2 weeks. After an addition of CDCA administration, the
      serum cholestanol levels steadily decreased, resulting in slight improvement of
      neurological symptoms. Patient 2 received a combined treatment with
      LDL-apheresis, CDCA and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This combination showed less
      LDL-apheresis-dependent fluctuation and more rapid decrease of serum cholestanol 
      levels than those in Patient 1, resulting in improvement and stabilization of the
      symptoms. Our results suggest that LDL-apheresis in combination with CDCA and
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor may have beneficial effects and can be one of the
      treatment options.

PG  - 217-24
AB  - Cholestanol, not cholesterol, is a minor component in the human body and in
      foods, but an increase in cholestanol concentration in serum induces a
      pathological condition named cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). In our
      investigation of this disease for more than 25 years, a procedure for
      quantification of cholestanol by high-performance liquid chromatography and an
      assay method for sterol 27-hydroxylase were established, and several mutations of
      the CYP 27 gene in 10 CTX families were identified. We also established
      experimental animal models with symptoms of CTX by feeding a high cholestanol
      diet. Corneal dystrophy and gallstones were produced in mice, and an apoptosis of
      cerebellar neuronal cells was observed in rats. We propose the following
      underlying mechanism of CTX pathogenesis: When cholesterol in the plasma membrane
      is replaced by cholestanol to some extent, the membrane fluidity is reduced, and 
      the calcium channel fails to open, inducing cell death. CTX patients are treated 
      with oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, which reduces the cholestanol 
      concentration in serum. Cholestanol has a toxic effect, and an imbalance of the
      cholesterol/cholestanol ratio in plasma membrane is suspected to cause the
      disturbance of calcium channel function of the membrane.

TI  - On the substrate specificity of human CYP27A1: implications for bile acid and
      cholestanol formation.
PG  - 1515-22
AB  - The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) is required for degradation of 
      the C27-sterol side chain in bile acid biosynthesis. CYP27A1 seems, however, to
      have roles beyond this, as illustrated by patients with a deficient sterol
      27-hydroxylase due to mutations of the CYP27A1 gene [cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX)]. These subjects have symptoms ranging from accumulation of
      bile alcohols and cholestanol to accelerated atherosclerosis and progressive
      neurologic impairment. The present work describes a detailed investigation on the
      substrate specificity of recombinant human CYP27A1. In accordance with some
      previous work with rat liver mitochondria, the activity in general increased with
      the polarity of the substrate. An obvious example was the finding that
      cholesterol was 27-hydroxylated more efficiently than cholesterol oleate but less
      efficiently than cholesterol sulfate. The oxysterols 24S-hydroxycholesterol and
      25-hydroxycholesterol were 27-hydroxylated less efficiently than cholesterol,
      possibly due to steric hindrance. Surprisingly, sterols with a 3-oxo-Delta4
      structure were found to be hydroxylated at a much higher rate than the
      corresponding sterols with a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta5 structure. The rates of
      hydroxylation of the sterols were:
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one>4-cholesten-3-one>7alpha-hydroxycholesterol>24-h
      ydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one>
      cholesterol>25-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one>24-hydroxycholesterol>or=25-hydroxychole
      sterol. The possibility is discussed that the findings may have implications for 
      oxysterol-mediated regulation of gene expression. The very high activity of
      CYP27A1 towards the cholestanol precursor 4-cholesten-3-one may be of importance 
      in connection with the accumulation of cholestanol in patients with CTX.

TI  - An autopsy case of gallbladder cancer developing in a Japanese man with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: genetic analysis of the sterol 27-hydroxylase and
      p53 genes.
PG  - 141-4
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid-storage 
      disorder characterised by xanthomas, neurological dysfunctions and premature
      atherosclerosis. A case of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the
      gallbladder occurring in a 57-year-old Japanese man with CTX, confirmed
      clinically, biochemically and at autopsy is reported together with analyses of
      the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) and p53 genes. A missense mutation of the p53
      (G for C) was detected in the gallbladder adenocarcinoma. Direct sequence
      analysis also showed a silent mutational substitution of unknown significance, C 
      for A, in CYP27 at codon 89. In the past, CTX patients have only demonstrated
      this infrequently, indicating no direct relationship between CYP27 dysfunction
      and tumour development. Thus, the present case of gallbladder cancer appears to
      be a chance occurrence.

TI  - Quantification of brain damage in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with
      magnetization transfer MR imaging.
PG  - 495-500
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging for quantification of brain
      damage in monitoring the evolution of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) has
      limitations. Magnetization transfer (MT) MR imaging is overcoming these
      limitations. Using MT MR imaging, we sought to quantify, in vivo, the extent of
      brain and cerebellar damage in patients with CTX, with the ulimate goal to
      investigate the magnitude of the correlation between MT MR imaging findings and
      clinical disability. METHODS: Conventional and MT MR images of the brain were
      obtained in nine patients with CTX and in 10 sex- and age-matched healthy
      volunteers. MT ratio histograms were derived of the whole brain, brain
      normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), brain normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM), 
      cerebellar NAWM, and cerebellar NAGM. Clinical disability was measured by using
      the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). RESULTS: Average MT ratio and peak
      heights of the whole brain, brain NAWM, and brain NAGM histograms in patients
      with CTX were significantly lower than the corresponding quantities in the
      control subjects. All cerebellar NAGM MT ratio histogram-derived metrics and
      average MT ratio of the cerebellar NAWM histogram in patients with CTX were also 
      significantly lower than the corresponding quantities in the control subjects.
      Strong correlations were found between the EDSS score and a composite whole-brain
      MT ratio histogram score (r = 0.77, P <.01) and a composite brain white matter MT
      ratio histogram score (r = 0.71, P <.03). A strong correlation was also found
      between the cerebellar functional system score and a composite cerebellar NAWM
      score (r = 0.72, P <.02). CONCLUSION: The quantitative assessment of brain damage
      in patients with CTX with use of MT MR imaging can provide powerful measures of
      disease outcome.

TI  - Identification of an endogenous ligand that activates pregnane X
      receptor-mediated sterol clearance.
PG  - 833-8
AB  - The nuclear receptor PXR (pregnane X receptor) is a broad-specificity sensor that
      recognizes a wide variety of synthetic drugs and xenobiotic agents. On activation
      by these compounds, PXR coordinately induces a network of transporters,
      cytochrome P450 enzymes, and other genes that effectively clear xenobiotics from 
      the liver and intestine. Like PXR, the majority of its target genes also possess 
      a broad specificity for exogenous compounds. Thus, PXR is both a sensor and
      effector in a well integrated and generalized pathway for chemical immunity.
      Although it is clear that PXR responds to numerous foreign compounds, it is
      unclear whether it possesses an endogenous ligand. To address this issue, we
      noted that there is substantial overlap in the substrate specificities of PXR and
      its critical CYP3A target gene. This prompted us to ask whether endogenous CYP3A 
      substrates also serve as PXR ligands. We demonstrate that
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol (triol), a cholesterol-derived CYP3A
      substrate, is a potent PXR agonist that effectively induces cyp3a expression in
      mice. This defines a critical salvage pathway that can be autoinduced to minimize
      triol accumulation. In contrast, triol can accumulate to very high levels in
      humans, and unlike mice, these people develop the severe clinical manifestations 
      of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The reason for these dramatic species
      differences has remained unclear. We now demonstrate that triol fails to activate
      human PXR or induce the CYP3A-salvage pathway. This explains why humans are more 
      susceptible to sterol accumulation and suggests that synthetic ligands for human 
      PXR could be used to treat cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and other disorders of 
      cholesterol excess.

TI  - Mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A) cause hepatitis of infancy
      as well as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 501-13
AB  - Follow-up investigations were undertaken on a previously reported patient who had
      severe familial giant cell hepatitis in infancy associated with substantially
      increased urinary excretion of bile alcohol glucuronides. By the age of 11 years,
      he had developed a profile of cholanoids in plasma and urine that closely
      resembled the pattern seen in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Sequencing of
      the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27A) showed that he was homozygous for a
      deletion (525/526delG) that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. This 
      genotype has previously been described in an adult female with classical symptoms
      of CTX (tendon xanthomata, cataracts and deteriorating cognitive function). A
      review of past medical histories of a group of patients with CTX revealed that
      prolonged neonatal cholestatic jaundice was common. The family histories also
      revealed fetal and neonatal deaths among siblings of patients with CTX. We
      conclude that defective activity of cholesterol 27-hydroxylase can lead to
      neonatal cholestatic jaundice ('hepatitis of infancy'), which may be
      self-limiting. After a latent period, however, progressive accumulation of
      cholesterol and cholestanol can lead to the xanthomata, neurodegeneration,
      cataracts and atherosclerosis that are typical of CTX.

      in the activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), which catalyzes side-chain
      hydroxylations of bile acid intermediates, thereby facilitating their excretion
      in the bile and urine. We examine the role of the nuclear xenobiotic receptor PXR
      (pregnane X receptor) in this process. We demonstrate that expression of Cyp3a11 
      and other established PXR target genes is increased in the Cyp27a1(-/-) mice.
      WhenCyp27a1(-/-) mice are fed a diet containing either cholic acid or
      chenodeoxycholic acid, expression of CYP7A1, which catalyzes the rate-limiting
      step in bile acid biosynthesis, is strongly suppressed. In parallel, the
      induction of Cyp3a11 observed in these mice is reversed, suggesting that bile
      acid intermediates serve as PXR activators. In support of this hypothesis, three 
      potentially toxic sterols (7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one,
      5beta-cholestan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol, and 4-cholesten-3-one), including
      two that are known to accumulate in Cyp27a1(-/-) mice, are efficacious activators
      of mouse PXR. All three compounds are more potent activators of mouse PXR than of
      human PXR, which may explain in part why humans who lack functional CYP27A1 do
      not display a corresponding increase in CYP3A activity and are stricken with the 
      disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Taken together, these results reveal the 
      existence of a feedforward regulatory loop by which potentially toxic bile acid
      intermediates activate PXR and induce their own metabolism. In addition, this
      study demonstrates that animal models with alterations in gene expression can be 
      used to identify endogenous ligands for orphan nuclear receptors.

PG  - 647-50
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a genetic disorder caused by a
      27-hydroxilase enzyme deficiency, leading to beta-cholestanol storage in many
      body tissues. Clinically, the disease is characterised by the presence of
      tendinous xanthomas, juvenile cataracts and progressive neurologic dysfunction.
      The diagnosis requires beta-cholestanol quantification in serum. We report two
      siblings with a history of photosensitive epilepsy of childhood onset, who
      developed progressive spastic paraparesis and cataracts in their third decade of 
      life. They were diagnosed to have CTX in spite of the absence of tendinous
      xanthomas. Cranial and spinal MRI only showed bilateral high intensity signal in 
      the dentate nuclei in the T2-weighted and proton-density sequences. Our patients 
      presented with a progressive spastic paraparesis. The delay in the diagnosis in
      our case could be due to the absence of tendinous xanthomas and late-onset
      cataracts. The recognition of the disease is important, because the treatment
      with chenodeoxycholic acid induces a decrement of beta-cholestanol levels in
      serum and could prevent the progression of the disease.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of
      bile acid synthesis which can be clinically diagnosed and specifically treated.
      It is an underdiagnosed disorder worldwide.Here,we describe two women who were
      diagnosed with CTX during their forties after symptoms had already developed 15
      years earlier. Both patients showed gait ataxia, spastic paraparesis,
      polyneuropathy, bilateral premature cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and cognitive
      deficits. One of the patients had also chronic diarrhea. The deficiency of the
      mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase results in a virtual absence of
      chenodeoxycholic acid. This leads to excessive production of cholestanol and
      cholesterol and accumulation of these sterols in many tissues, especially the eye
      lens, central nervous system,and tendons. The determination of a high cholestanol
      serum level allows the diagnosis,which can be confirmed through genetic analysis.
      Early diagnosis of CTX is important, since an effective therapy is available.
      Long-term therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid is effective for CTX, mainly in
      prevention of further deterioration.

      determination.
PG  - 859-61
AB  - AIM: To assess the specificity and sensitivity of the commonly used enzymatic
      colorimetric test for plasma cholesterol determination. METHODS: Interference
      with an enzymatic method for cholesterol measurement by several non-cholesterol
      sterols (beta sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, stigmastanol, desmosterol,
      and lathosterol) was assessed. Some of these compounds are present in plasma at
      higher than normal concentrations either in rare genetic disorders, such as
      phytosterolaemia, or after the consumption of phytosterol enriched foods.
      RESULTS: The non-cholesterol sterols were detected by the assay in a linear
      manner. There was no competitive interference in the presence of cholesterol.
      CONCLUSIONS: This crossreactivity may affect the diagnosis and treatment of
      non-cholesterol dyslipidaemias, including phytosterolaemia and cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis. Similarly, changes in plasma lipid compositions after the
      consumption of phytosterol enriched foods cannot be specifically determined by
      this enzymatic assay. Until a more specific enzymatic assay is developed,
      alternative methods such as gas chromatography should be used to differentiate
      between cholesterol and non-cholesterol sterols.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: molecular characterization of two Scandinavian
      sisters.
PG  - 259-64
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a hereditary disorder, which is inherited
      as an autosomally recessive disease, causing production of cholesterol and
      cholestanol xanthomas and mental retardation. The disease is caused by mutations 
      in the gene for sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). The only CTX patients diagnosed 
      in Scandinavia are two Norwegian sisters from a consanguineous marriage. Here we 
      have characterized the mutation and its functional consequences for the enzyme.
      Analysis of genomic DNA from cultured fibroblasts identified a base exchange C > 
      T in position 1441, causing arginine at amino acid position 441 to be replaced by
      tryptophan. The same mutation was introduced by mutagenesis in the complimentary 
      DNA (cDNA) for CYP27, ligated into the expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax and
      transfected into HEK293 cells. The mutated enzyme had less than 5% of the enzyme 
      activity compared with the native enzyme. No abnormal catalytic products could be
      identified in the cell culture medium. Probably the mutation affects the haem
      binding within the holoenzyme. The mutation has also previously been reported in 
      a Japanese family. This is the second example of a CTX-causing mutation that has 
      been recognized in more than one population.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with psychiatric disorders: report of three
      siblings and literature review.
PG  - 334-40
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare familial lipid metabolic disease
      inherited via an autosomal recessive trait, is caused by mutations of the sterol 
      27-hydroxylase gene. Psychiatric disorders may occur in patients with CTX. In
      Taiwan, Chang et al presented patients with CTX. However, there has not been a
      case presented about CTX with psychiatric disorders in Taiwan. We present three
      siblings in one family with CTX combined with moderate mental retardation. One of
      the siblings had long-term depressed mood, irritability, poor appetite, insomnia,
      fatigability, and pessimistic thinking and was diagnosed as dysthymic disorder.
      After 2.5 years of antidepressant treatment at our outpatient clinic, the
      depressive symptoms of the dysthymic sibling improved greatly. However, the
      results of the IQ tests of the three siblings did not change after effective
      treatments for physical manifestations of CTX. In addition, the authors reviewed 
      the literature of CTX combined with psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Mechanism of accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in tendons and the role 
      of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1).
PG  - 1129-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tendon xanthomas are deposits of lipids and connective tissue commonly
      found in hypercholesterolemic patients. Macrophages are likely to be responsible 
      for the lipid accumulation. Normolipidemic patients with the rare disease
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, lacking the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase
      (CYP27A1), develop prominent xanthomas in tendons and brain containing both
      cholestanol and cholesterol, with a cholestanol:cholesterol ratio higher than
      that in the circulation. Because of its ability to convert cholesterol into polar
      metabolites that leave the cells faster, CYP27A1 has been suggested to be an
      antiatherogenic enzyme. The hypothesis was tested that tendons contain CYP27A1
      that may be of importance for the normal efflux of both steroids. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Western blotting and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      showed that human tendons contain significant amounts of CYP27A1 and its product,
      27-hydroxycholesterol. Immunohistochemistry showed that CYP27A1 is present in
      macrophages and tenocytes. The tendons also contained cholestanol, with a
      cholestanol:cholesterol ratio slightly higher than that in the circulation.
      Recombinant human CYP27A1, and cultured human macrophages containing this enzyme,
      had similar activity toward cholesterol and cholestanol. After loading of
      macrophages with labeled cholesterol and cholestanol, there was an efflux of
      these steroids in both unmetabolized and 27-oxygenated form, resulting in a
      significant cellular accumulation of cholestanol compared with cholesterol.
      CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with the possibility that CYP27A1 is of
      importance for the efflux of both cholesterol and cholestanol from tendons.

TI  - Two novel mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene causing cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare recessive autosomal disease caused
      by mutations of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene. Clinically, CTX is characterized 
      by tendon xanthomas, cataracts and progressive neurological deficits. Because of 
      the disruption of the 27-hydroxylase activity, CTX patients have elevated plasma 
      levels of cholestanol, a by-product of abnormal bile acid synthesis. The present 
      authors describe a female patient with CTX. The proband in this study presented
      with elevated cholestanol levels, markedly reduced mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase
      activity and altered bile acid composition. The 27-hydroxylase gene was analysed 
      for mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the exons and the
      splice-junction regions of the gene. The proband was found to be a compound
      heterozygote for two different mutations which have not been previously
      described: (1) a G --> A transition at nucleotide 455 that is responsible for
      converting a glycine to a glutamic acid residue at amino acid position 112
      (G112E); and (2) a five-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 (from nucleotide 965 to
      969) that is responsible for a shift in the reading frame and the insertion of a 
      premature codon at position 296, and consequently, the synthesis of a truncated
      protein lacking the heme-binding and andrenodoxin-binding domains. Long-term
      (18-year) treatment of the proband with chenodeoxycholic acid (750 mg day-1) has 
      been effective in preventing any progression of the disease.

TI  - 25R,26-Hydroxycholesterol revisited: synthesis, metabolism, and biologic roles.
PG  - 665-70
AB  - The CYP27 gene is expressed in arterial endothelium, macrophages, and other
      tissues. The gene product generates sterol intermediates that function as ligands
      for nuclear receptors prior to their transport to the liver for metabolism,
      mostly to bile acids. Most attention has been given to 27-hydroxycholesterol as a
      ligand for LXR activated receptors and to chenodeoxycholic acid as a ligand for
      farnesoid X activated receptors (FXRs). Expression of the pathway in macrophages 
      is essential for normal reverse cholesterol transport. Thus, ABC transporter
      activity is upregulated, which enhances cholesterol efflux. Absence of these
      mechanisms probably accounts for the accelerated atherosclerosis that occurs in
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in human
      atheroma is puzzling and may reflect low levels of oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase
      activity in human macrophages. The same enzyme determines the proportion of
      mono-, di-, and tri-hydroxy bile acids synthesized in the liver. Oxysterol
      7alpha-hydroxylase deficiency is a molecular basis for cholestatic liver disease.
      Chenodeoxycholic acid, the major normal end product, downregulates expression of 
      cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase via the FXR/short heterodimer protein nuclear
      receptor and thus limits total bile acid production. The challenge is to quantify
      in a physiologic setting the magnitude of the pathway in different tissues and to
      further evaluate the biologic roles of all the intermediates that may function as
      ligands for orphan nuclear receptors or via other regulatory mechanisms.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare disease with diverse manifestations.
PG  - 527-9
AB  - This mini-review deals with a new appraisal of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In
      addition to neurologic symptoms, patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
      develop cataracts, diarrhea, Achilles tendon xanthoma, atherosclerotic vascular
      disease, and many other abnormalities. Although the pathophysiology of the
      disease is not completely understood, excess production and consequent
      accumulation of cholestanol in tissues may play a crucial role. Chenodeoxycholic 
      acid is the most effective therapy. The causative role and detrimental effects
      (at a low plasma level) of cholestanol merit further investigation.

TI  - Imaging of white matter lesions.
PG  - 21-30
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive for the detection of white
      matter lesions (WML), which occur even in normal ageing. Intrinsic WML should be 
      separated from physiological changes in the ageing brain, such as periventricular
      caps and bands, and from dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Genuine WML are best seen 
      with T2-weighted sequences such as long TR dual-echo spin-echo or FLAIR
      (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery); the latter has the advantage of easily
      separating WML from CSF-like lesions. Abnormal T2 signal in MRI is not specific, 
      and can accompany any change in tissue composition. In the work-up of WML in
      small vessel disease, magnetic resonance angiography can be used to rule out
      (concomitant) large vessel disease, and diffusion-weighted MRI to identify new
      ischaemic lesions (amidst pre-existing old WML). The differential diagnosis of
      WML includes hereditary leukodystrophies and acquired disorders. The
      leukodystrophies that can present in adult age include metachromatic
      leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial
      disorders, vanishing white matter, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These
      metabolic disorders typically present with symmetrical abnormalities that can be 
      very diffuse, often with involvement of brainstem and cerebellum. Only the
      mitochondrial disorders tend to be more asymmetric and frequently involve the
      grey matter preferentially. Among the acquired white matter disorders,
      hypoxic-ischaemic causes are by far the most prevalent and without further
      clinical clues there is no need to even consider the next most common disorder,
      i.e. multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the nonischaemic disorders, MS is far more
      common than vasculitis, infection, intoxication and trauma. While vasculitis can 
      mimic small vessel disease, MS has distinctive features with preferential
      involvement of the subcortical U-fibres, the corpus callosum, temporal lobes and 
      the brainstem/cerebellum. Spinal cord lesions are very common in MS, but do not
      occur in normal ageing nor in small vessel disease.

AB  - Cerebrontendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive
      neurometabolic disease involving lipid metabolism. The classical phenotype is
      characterized by neurological dysfunction, tendon xanthomas and juvenile
      cataracts. Other ophthalmological findings have occasionally been reported. To
      gain more insight into the type and frequency of ophthalmological alterations in 
      this multisystem metabolic disorder, we examined 13 CTX patients. Besides
      cataracts, found in all cases, the second most frequent ocular abnormality was
      paleness of the optic disk, which was found in 6 patients and was probably
      previously underestimated. Signs of premature retinal senescence were also
      observed. We discuss the possible relation between these ocular manifestations
      and the metabolic defect.

PG  - 203-36
AB  - Increased levels of plasma sterols other than cholesterol can serve as markers
      for abnormalities in lipid metabolism associated with clinical disease. Premature
      atherosclerosis and xanthomatosis occur in two rare lipid storage diseases,
      Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and sitosterolemia. In CTX, cholestanol is
      present in all tissues. In sitosterolemia, dietary campesterol and sitosterol
      accumulate in plasma and red blood cells. Plasma accumulation of oxo-sterols is
      associated with inhibition of bile acid synthesis and other abnormalities in
      plasma lipid metabolism. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis is associated
      with plasma appearance of precursor sterols. The increases in non-cholesterol
      sterols, while highly significant, represent only minor changes in plasma
      sterols, which require capillary gas-liquid chromatography and MS for effective
      detection, identification and quantification.

      patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type I (VDDR-I) and cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX).
PG  - 6607-15
AB  - We have determined eight types of missense mutants of CYP27B1 from Japanese
      vitamin D-dependent rickets type I (VDDR-I) patients [Kitanaka, S., Takeyama, K.,
      Murayama, A., Sato, T., Okumura, K., Nogami, M., Hasegawa, Y., Niimi, H.,
      Yanagisawa, J., Tanaka, T. & Kato, S. (1998) New England J. Med., 338, 653-661
      and Kitanaka, S., Murayama, A., Sakaki, T., Inouye, K., Seino, Y., Fukumoto, S., 
      Shima, M., Yukizane, S., Takayanagi, M., Niimi, H., Takeyama, K. & Kato, S.
      (1999) J. Clin. Endocrine Metab., 84, 4111-4117]. None of the CYP27B1 mutants
      showed 1alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Thus, it was
      assumed that the mutated amino-acid residues play important roles in the
      1alpha-hydroxylase activity, such as substrate binding, activation of molecular
      oxygen, interaction with adrenodoxin, and folding of the cytochrome P450
      structure. To examine our hypothesis, we generated various mutants of CYP27B1 and
      studied their enzymatic properties. In addition, the corresponding mutations were
      introduced to CYP27A1, which belongs to the same family as CYP27B1. As CYP27A1
      showed much higher expression level than CYP27B1 in Escherichia coli, further
      analysis including heme-binding and substrate-binding was performed with CYP27A1 
      in place of CYP27B1. Western blot analysis, spectral analysis including reduced
      CO-difference spectra and substrate-induced difference spectra, and enzymatic
      analysis of the mutant CYP27A1 gave information on the structure-function
      relationships of both CYP27A1 and CYP27B1. Although the sequence alignment
      suggested that Arg107, Gly125, and Pro497 of CYP27B1 might be involved in
      substrate binding, the experimental data strongly suggested that mutations of
      these amino-acid residues destroyed the tertiary structure of the substrate-heme 
      pocket. It was also suggested that Arg389 and Arg453 of CYP27B1 were involved in 
      heme-propionate binding, and Asp164 stabilized the four-helix bundle consisting
      of D, E, I and J helices, possibly by forming a salt bridge. Thr321 was found to 
      be responsible for the activation of molecular oxygen.

TI  - Oxidized plant sterols in human serum and lipid infusions as measured by combined
      gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
PG  - 2030-8
AB  - Some oxidized forms of cholesterol (oxysterols) are thought to be atherogenic and
      cytotoxic. Because plant sterols are structurally related to cholesterol, we
      examined whether oxidized plant sterols (oxyphytosterols) could be identified in 
      human serum and soy-based lipid emulsions. We first prepared both deuterated and 
      nondeuterated reference compounds. We then analyzed by gas-liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry the oxyphytosterol concentrations in serum from 
      patients with phytosterolemia or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, in a pool serum 
      and in two lipid emulsions. 7-Ketositosterol, 7 beta-hydroxysitosterol, 5 alpha, 
      6 alpha-epoxysitosterol, 3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-sitostanetriol, and probably also 
      7 alpha-hydroxysitosterol were present in markedly elevated concentrations in
      serum from phytosterolemic patients only. Also, campesterol oxidation products
      such as 7 alpha-hydroxycampesterol and 7 beta-hydroxycampesterol were found.
      Interestingly, sitosterol was oxidized for approximately 1.4% in phytosterolemic 
      serum, which is rather high compared with the approximate 0.01% oxidatively
      modified cholesterol normally seen in human serum. The same oxyphytosterols were 
      also found in two lipid emulsions in which the ratio of oxidized sitosterol to
      sitosterol varied between 0.038 and 0.041. In conclusion, we have shown that
      oxidized forms of plant sterols are present in serum from phytosterolemic
      patients and two frequently used soy-based lipid emulsions. Currently, it is
      unknown whether oxyphytosterols affect health, as has been suggested for
      oxysterols. However, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol may be one of the more harmful
      oxysterols, and both sitosterol and campesterol were oxidized into 7
      beta-hydroxysitosterol and 7 beta-hydroxycampesterol. The relevance of these
      findings therefore deserves further exploration.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: 11-year treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid in
      five patients. An electrophysiological study.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - We report the electrophysiological follow-up of five cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis patients treated for 11 years with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).
      Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was reduced in three cases. P100 latency of
      visual evoked potentials was delayed in four cases, interpeaks I-III and I-V of
      brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) was increased in two and interpeak
      N13-20 of upper limb somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) was slowed in one.
      After 4 months of therapy with CDCA, NCV was normal and did not show any
      significant change during the 11 years of observation. Central motor conduction
      time of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and N24-P40 interpeak latency of lower
      limb SEPs were increased in five and four cases, respectively, in spite of
      2/3-year treatment with CDCA. Improvement of evoked potentials, especially of
      MEPs and SEPs, was slower and continued over the whole 11-year period. The size
      of xanthomas slightly decreased in some patients during treatment and the
      clinical manifestations stabilized, avoiding progressive worsening, but there was
      no significant improvement in neurological deficit. Two sisters of patients who
      never took CDCA showed progressive worsening of clinical manifestations, upper
      limb SEPs and BAEPs.

PG  - 1673-7
AB  - A 24-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy had suffered from diarrhoea, walking
      disorders, visual complaints and other complaints for many years. Once the
      suspicion of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) had been confirmed with
      biochemical and genetic tests and treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid had been
      started, the diarrhoea disappeared and the neurological symptoms lessened. CTX is
      a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disease. The clinical hallmarks are:
      bilateral juvenile cataract, chronic diarrhoea, progressive neurological symptoms
      and signs, and tendon xanthomas. The phenotypic variability often hinders the
      clinical diagnosis. The biochemical diagnosis can be made by determining the
      serum cholestanol level and the excretion of urinary bile alcohols, followed by a
      mutation analysis. CTX is a treatable disease and therefore an early diagnosis is
      important.

TI  - Advances in experimental dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.
PG  - 1173-83
AB  - Among the models of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, a number of wild-type,
      naturally defective, and genetically modified animals (rabbits, mice, pigeons,
      dogs, pigs, and monkeys) have been characterized. In particular, their
      similarities to and differences from humans in respect to relevant biochemical,
      physiologic, and pathologic conditions have been evaluated. Features of
      atherosclerotic lesions and their specific relationship to plasma lipoprotein
      particles have been critically reviewed and summarized. All animal models studied
      have limitations: the most significant advantages and disadvantages of using a
      specific animal species are outlined here. New insights in lipid metabolism and
      genetic background with regard to variations in pathogenesis of
      dyslipidemia-associated atherogenesis have also been reviewed. Evidence suggests 
      that among wild-type species, strains of White Carneau pigeons and Watanabe
      Heritable Hyperlipidemic and St. Thomas's Hospital rabbits are preferable to the 
      cholesterol-fed wild-type animal species in dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis
      research. Evidence for the usefulness of both wild-type and transgenic animals in
      studying the involvement of inflammatory pathways and Chlamydia pneumoniae
      infection in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has also been summarized. Transgenic
      mice and rabbits are excellent tools for studying specific gene-related
      disorders. However, despite these significant achievements in animal
      experimentation, there are no suitable animal models for several rare types of
      fatal dyslipidemia-associated disorders such as phytosterolemia and
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. An excellent model of diabetic atherosclerosis is
      unavailable. The question of reversibility of atherosclerosis still remains
      unanswered. Further work is needed to overcome these deficiencies.

TI  - 27-hydroxycholesterol is an endogenous ligand for liver X receptor in
      cholesterol-loaded cells.
PG  - 38378-87
AB  - The nuclear receptors liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) and LXRbeta
      (NR1H2) are important regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including
      ABCA1, ABCG1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c).
      Although it has been demonstrated that oxysterols are LXR ligands, little is
      known about the identity of the physiological activators of these receptors. Here
      we confirm earlier studies demonstrating a dose-dependent induction of ABCA1 and 
      ABCG1 in human monocyte-derived macrophages by cholesterol loading. In addition, 
      we show that formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid, products
      of CYP27 action on cholesterol, is dependent on the dose of cholesterol used to
      load the cells. Other proposed LXR ligands, including 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol,
      22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, could not be detected
      under these conditions. A role for CYP27 in regulation of cholesterol-induced
      genes was demonstrated by the following findings. 1) Introduction of CYP27 into
      HEK-293 cells conferred an induction of ABCG1 and SREBP-1c; 2) upon cholesterol
      loading, CYP27-expressing cells induce these genes to a greater extent than in
      control cells; 3) in CYP27-deficient human skin fibroblasts, the induction of
      ABCA1 in response to cholesterol loading was ablated; and 4) in a coactivator
      association assay, 27-hydroxycholesterol functionally activated LXR. We conclude 
      that 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is an important pathway for LXR activation
      in response to cholesterol overload.

PG  - 379-92
AB  - Of the primary dementing disorders that cause frontotemporal dementia, the
      best-known is Pick disease. We report on a 44-year-old woman with progressive
      frontal lobe dementia and spastic paraplegia. Examination revealed increased
      serum levels of cholestanol with abnormal cholesterol metabolism and a
      heterozygous mutation of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). Biochemical
      findings were compatible with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX); however, the 
      clinical manifestations were very dissimilar. To our knowledge, a symptomatic
      carrier of this mutation among CTX patients has not been reported. We speculate
      that the present patient has a previously undescribed neurodegenerative disease
      related to abnormal cholesterol metabolism with this heterozygous mutation.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 292-5
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive lipid-storage
      disease caused by mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene. The accumulation
      of cholestanol in various tissues characterizes this disease. Diagnosis is based 
      on determination of urinary bile alcohols. Therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid may
      arrest the progression of the disease. A 55-year-old woman presented with a
      slowly progressive paraparesia and two firm subcutaneous tumors over the knees.
      Her medical history revealed difficulty in standing and walking since infancy,
      bilateral juvenile cataracts, and mental retardation. Histopathologic examination
      of one subcutaneous tumor was consistent with tendinous xanthoma. Substantial
      elevation of urinary bile alcohols confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment with oral
      chenodeoxycholic acid was started, with only mild improvement of spasticity.
      Recognition of tendon xanthomas in a young patient with neurologic symptoms or
      cataracts (or both) is crucial to start early treatment and to avoid irreversible
      neurologic sequelae.

TI  - Side chain hydroxylations in bile acid biosynthesis catalyzed by CYP3A are
      markedly up-regulated in Cyp27-/- mice but not in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 34579-85
AB  - The accumulation of various 25-hydroxylated C(27)-bile alcohols in blood and
      their excretion in urine are characteristic features of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) a recessively inherited inborn error of bile acid synthesis
      caused by mutations in the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene.
      These bile alcohols may be intermediates in the alternative cholic acid side
      chain cleavage pathway. The present study was undertaken to identify enzymes and 
      reactions responsible for the formation of these bile alcohols and to explain why
      Cyp27(-/-) mice do not show CTX-related abnormalities. Microsomal activities of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 25- and 26-hydroxylases,
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol 23R-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxylases 
      and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase, a marker enzyme for CYP3A, in Cyp27(-/-) mice
      livers were markedly up-regulated (5.5-, 3.5-, 6.5-, 7.5-, 2.9-, and 5.4-fold,
      respectively). In contrast, these enzyme activities were not increased in CTX.
      The activities of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 25- and
      26-hydroxylases and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol 23R-, 24R-, 
      24S-, and 27-hydroxylases were strongly correlated with the activities of
      testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase in control human liver microsomes from eight
      unrelated donors. Troleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A, markedly
      suppressed these microsomal side chain hydroxylations in both mouse and human
      livers in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, experiments using recombinant
      overexpressed human CYP3A4 confirmed that these microsomal side chain
      hydroxylations were catalyzed by a single enzyme, CYP3A4. The results demonstrate
      that microsomal 25- and 26-hydroxylations of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol and microsomal 23R-, 24R-, 24S-, and
      27-hydroxylations of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol are mainly 
      catalyzed by CYP3A in both mice and humans. Unlike Cyp27(-/-) mice, CYP3A
      activity was not up-regulated despite marked accumulation of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol in CTX.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in three siblings from a Chinese family.
PG  - 30-2
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is exceptionally rare in the Chinese
      population. We reported a 31-year-old Chinese male in Hong Kong, who has the
      characteristic features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis including the multiple 
      xanthomas of tendons, mental retardation, bilateral cataracts, cerebellar ataxia 
      and spasticity of the left arm, high concentrations of plasma phytosterols and
      abnormal MR of brain. On screening the family, two other siblings of 27 and 29
      respectively, have tendon xanthomas and high plasma phytosterols. An extensive
      search of the international medical literature, including the Medline, has
      revealed only one other case report of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in Taiwan. 
      CTX is a potentially treatable disease. It is hoped by alertness, early diagnosis
      and treatment can be made, and hence prevent further progression of the disease.

AB  - Two cases of sugically treated hand tendon xanthomas are presented. On surgical
      exploration, these xanthomas were found to be intertwined within the extensor
      mechanism. Total excision was not possible because it risked loss of integrity of
      the extensor mechanism. Both patients regained full range of motion and
      experienced no progressive tumor growth at a minimum of 1-year follow-up.

TI  - Clinical and biochemical features, molecular diagnosis and long-term management
      of a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 63-9
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive sterol storage
      disease characterised clinically by juvenile bilateral cataracts, progressive
      neurological dysfunction, and formation of tendon xanthomata. We describe the
      clinical and biochemical features, molecular diagnosis and long-term management
      of the first reported Australasian case of CTX. Molecular analysis confirmed the 
      diagnosis of CTX and demonstrated that the patient was homozygous for a G-->A
      transition in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the sterol 27-hydroxylase
      gene. Serum cholestanol concentrations were decreased with the HMG-CoA reductase 
      inhibitor simvastatin alone and greater reductions were achieved after the
      addition of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid; suggesting a synergistic effect 
      of this combination. Despite serum cholestanol concentrations remaining within
      the low-normal range, there has been no significant improvement in mental and
      physical abilities or in EEG abnormalities with 5 years of treatment. Metabolism 
      of radiolabeled 7-ketocholesterol to aqueous soluble products was absent in
      CTX-derived macrophages. Consistent with this finding, plasma 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol
      concentrations were increased in the CTX subject compared with controls.

TI  - Differences in hepatic levels of intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis between 
      Cyp27(-/-) mice and CTX.
PG  - 291-300
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, recessively inherited lipid
      storage disease characterized by a markedly reduced production of
      chenodeoxycholic acid and an increased formation of 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols
      and cholestanol. Patients with this disease are known to have mutations in the
      sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27) gene. However, one study showed that mice with a
      disrupted Cyp27 gene did not have any CTX-related clinical or biochemical
      abnormalities. To explore the reason, hepatic cholesterol, cholestanol, and 12
      intermediates in bile acid biosynthetic pathways were quantified in 10 Cyp27(-/-)
      and 7 Cyp27(+/+) mice, two CTX patients (untreated and treated with
      chenodeoxycholic acid), and four human control subjects by high resolution gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mitochondrial 27-hydroxycholesterol and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,27-tetrol were virtually absent in both
      Cyp27(-/-) mice and CTX patients. In Cyp27(-/-) mice, microsomal concentrations
      of intermediates in the early bile acid biosynthetic pathway
      (7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one,
      7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol), 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols
      (5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol,
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,23R,25-pentol, and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24R, 25-pentol), and cholestanol were all 
      significantly elevated compared with those in Cyp27(+/+) mice, although the
      levels were lower than those in untreated CTX patients. The intermediate levels
      in early bile acid biosynthesis were more elevated in male (16;-86% of CTX) than 
      in female Cyp27(-/-) mice (7-30% of CTX). In contrast, 25-hydroxylated bile
      alcohol concentrations were not significantly different between male and female
      Cyp27(-/-) mice and were considerably lower (less than 14%) than those in CTX
      patients.These results suggest that 1) in Cyp27(-/-) mice, especially in females,
      classic bile acid biosynthesis via 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol is not stimulated as
      much as in CTX patients; and 2) formed 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols are more
      efficiently metabolized in Cyp27(-/-) mice than in CTX patients.

TI  - Fine-mapping, mutation analyses, and structural mapping of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis in U.S. pedigrees.
PG  - 159-69
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of
      bile acid biosynthesis. Clinically, CTX patients present with tendon xanthomas,
      juvenile cataracts, and progressive neurological dysfunction and can be diagnosed
      by the detection of elevated plasma cholestanol levels. CTX is caused by
      mutations affecting the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27 ). CTX has been
      identified in a number of populations, but seems to have a higher prevalence in
      the Japanese, Sephardic Jewish, and Italian populations. We have assembled 12
      previously unreported pedigrees from the United States. The CYP27 locus had been 
      previously mapped to chromosome 2q33-qter. We performed linkage analyses and
      found no evidence of genetic heterogeneity. All CTX patients showed segregation
      with the CYP27 locus, and haplotype analysis and recombinant events allowed us to
      precisely map CYP27 to chromosome 2q35, between markers D2S1371 and D2S424.
      Twenty-three mutations were identified from 13 probands analyzed thus far; 11
      were compound heterozygotes and 2 had homozygous mutations. Of these, five are
      novel mutations [Trp100Stop, Pro408Ser, Gln428Stop, a 10-base pair (bp) deletion 
      in exon 1, and a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 of the CYP27 gene]. Three-dimensional
      structural modeling of sterol 27-hydroxylase showed that, while the majority of
      the missense mutations disrupt the heme-binding and adrenodoxin-binding domains
      critical for enzyme activity, two missense mutations (Arg94Trp/Gln and Lys226Arg)
      are clearly located outside these sites and may identify a potential
      substrate-binding or other protein contact site.

TI  - Diphenylpyraline-responsive parkinsonism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis:
      long-term follow up of three patients.
PG  - 95-7
AB  - A long-term follow-up study was made of three patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) associated with parkinsonism, two of whom were siblings.
      Besides typical CTX symptoms, all three patients showed severe parkinsonism. This
      observation has been rarely reported in CTX. The fact that the two siblings
      showed parkinsonism strongly suggests the genetic propensity to parkinsonism in
      these CTX patients. Positron emission tomography studies of the two patients
      revealed presynaptic dysfunction of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system.
      Treatment with the reductase inhibitor hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme
      successfully corrected the serum cholestanol level in the early stage of the
      disease, which, however, did not arrest the progression of clinical symptoms,
      particularly their parkinsonism. Clinically, levodopa had a little effect on
      parkinsonism, whereas an antihistamine drug, diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (DPP)
      had excellent effects on all three patients throughout the long-term follow up.
      The mechanism of the action of DPP on parkinsonism is unclear, however, the drug 
      seems to be a therapeutic choice for treating parkinsonism in CTX.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic changes in brains of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 121-31
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare disorder due to an inherited
      defect in the metabolic pathway of cholesterol. Early diagnosis of the disease is
      particularly important as patients benefit from therapy with chenodeoxycholic
      acid. Although the disease is clinically characterized by the concomitant
      presence of tendon xanthomas, juvenile cataracts and progressive neurological
      impairment, clinical features may vary greatly. Neuroradiological studies have
      suggested that the bilateral abnormality of the dentate nuclei could be typical
      of this disease. However, this finding has been seen inconsistently on
      conventional MRI. The dynamic of the CNS pathology in CTX is complex, and whether
      demyelination or axonopathy has primary importance in the pathogenesis of CTX
      pathology is not known. To clarify both neuroradiological and pathological
      issues, we performed combined brain MRI and spectroscopy examinations on 12 CTX
      patients. On conventional MRIs, bilateral hyperintensities of the dentate nuclei 
      were clearly seen in nine out of 12 patients on T(2) -weighted MRIs, but were
      evident in all patients using a FLAIR sequence. On proton magnetic resonance (MR)
      spectroscopy, significant decreases in N: -acetylaspartate resonance intensities 
      (P: <0.0001) and increases in lactate MR signals (P<0.05) were found in the group
      of CTX patients in large volumes of interest localized above the lateral brain
      ventricles and in the cerebellar hemispheres. Cerebral values of N
      -acetylaspartate resonance intensities showed a close correlation with patients' 
      disability (Spearman rank correlation = -0.78, P<0.005). These results suggest
      that MR abnormalities in the dentate nuclei may be evident consistently in
      patients with CTX. Proton MR spectroscopy data demonstrated widespread axonal
      damage (as shown by the decrease in N -acetylaspartate) and diffuse brain
      mitochondrial dysfunction (as shown by the increase in brain parenchymal lactate)
      in patients with CTX. The close correlation seen between values of the putative
      axonal marker N-acetylaspartate and patients' disability scores suggests that
      proton MR spectroscopy can provide a useful measure of disease outcome in CTX.

AB  - Expression of the gene coding for the synthesis of 25(R), 26-hydroxycholesterol
      in many tissues and the finding that this sterol can be the sole pathway for the 
      production of bile acids have led to a renewed interest in this metabolic
      pathway. A further impetus for exploring the normal biologic roles that are
      served by expression of the CYP27A1 gene is the knowledge that mutations in
      humans are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and with severe neurologic
      impairment. The molecular mechanisms governing these phenotypic expressions are
      not known but in light of the traditional role of steroids as ligands for
      receptors that regulate gene expression it seems likely that the intermediates in
      this pathway modulate a number of enzymatic activities that remain to be
      elucidated.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: the spectrum of imaging findings and the
      correlation with neuropathologic findings.
PG  - 869-76
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe imaging findings and their neuropathologic correlate in
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images in 24 patients with 
      symptoms (mean age at time of imaging, 37 years; mean disease duration, 18 years)
      were reviewed for site and frequency of brain, spinal cord, and Achilles tendon
      involvement. Two patients died, and imaging findings were compared with
      postmortem neuropathologic findings. RESULTS: Apart from nonspecific
      supratentorial atrophy and deep white matter changes, more typical hyperintense
      lesions were seen on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus (in 79% of
      patients), globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and inferior olive and extended
      into adjacent white matter as disease progressed. In these locations, lipid
      crystal clefts and perivascular macrophages, neuronal loss, demyelination,
      fibrosis, and reactive astrocytosis were found at microscopic examination.
      Hypointensity was sometimes found on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus
      and was related to deposition of hemosiderin and calcifications. CT depicted
      fewer lesions; all had low attenuation, except for the calcifications. Spinal
      cord MR imaging revealed increased signal intensity in the lateral and dorsal
      columns on T2-weighted images. Achilles tendon xanthomas displayed intermediate
      signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. CONCLUSION: The typical pattern
      of MR imaging findings reflects the classic histopathologic findings and should
      prompt the diagnosis of CTX.

TI  - A new method for determination of serum cholestanol by high-performance liquid
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection.
PG  - 345-52
AB  - We developed a method for the determination of serum 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol
      (cholestanol). The sterols were derivatized to the 4'-bromobenzenesulfonyl esters
      and heated in isopropanol. The cholesterol-4'-bromobenzenesulfonate was
      solvolyzed to cholesteryl isopropyl ether, but the derivatized cholestanol did
      not change and could be measured in a high-performance liquid chromatographic
      system equipped with a UV detector at 235 nm. On the other hand, the resulting
      cholesteryl isopropyl ether, having different absorbance and chromatographic
      mobility was not detected. This method was used for measuring cholestanol levels 
      in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), liver cirrhosis and serum 
      from healthy control subjects. Reproducibility, linearity and recovery tests were
      done on 0.3 ml of serum samples containing >2 microg/ml cholestanol, using
      stigmastanol as an internal standard (I.S.). Determining cholestenol by this
      method can be used for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with CTX and various
      liver diseases.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Controversies about nerve and muscle:
      observations in ten patients.
PG  - 407-14
AB  - Neuromuscular characteristics were documented in ten patients with biochemically 
      and genetically confirmed cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. An array of genotypes
      was found in these patients. Only one patient complained of muscle weakness,
      while clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy were present in six patients.
      Electromyogram showed predominantly axonal neuropathy in seven patients.
      Neurogenic changes were seen in muscle biopsies of nine patients. Sural nerve
      biopsies of three patients showed features of axonal neuropathy. In addition, in 
      one patient, extensive onion bulb formation was seen, which is indicative of a
      primarily demyelinating process. Five patients had normal mitochondrial
      respiratory chain enzyme activity. It is concluded that myopathy is not a feature
      of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and that the most prominent neuromuscular
      abnormality is sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy.

PG  - 222-6
AB  - A 63-years-old woman noticed unsteady gait at the age of 56 years and then
      developed dysarthria two years later. A general physical examination at age 56
      revealed mild hypertrophy of both Achilles tendons. On neurological examination, 
      she had scanning speech, moderate limb and truncal ataxia, and moderate
      hyperreflexia of all limbs. A soft tissue X-ray examination disclosed hypertrophy
      of both Achilles tendons with multiple punctate calcification. Brain MRI showed
      diffuse cerebellar atrophy. Motor evoked potentials in the right limb disclosed a
      prolonged central conduction time. Blood chemistry showed familial type IIa
      hypercholesterolemia (cholesterol 320 mg/dl, and LDL-cholesterol 245 mg/dl), yet 
      cholestanol level was normal. A examination of CTX gene mutation at hot spots
      revealed no mutation. Her mother and two siblings also had hypertrophy of
      Achilles tendons as well as type IIa hypercholesterolemia. In addition, the one
      sibling showed mild ataxia of lower limbs, respectively. This report suggests a
      possible link between familial type IIa hypercholesterolemia and cerebellar
      degeneration syndrome clinically mimicking CTX.

TI  - Sterol 27-hydroxylase acts on 7-ketocholesterol in human atherosclerotic lesions 
      and macrophages in culture.
PG  - 27627-33
AB  - 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27OH) is the major oxysterol in human atherosclerotic
      lesions, followed by 7-ketocholesterol (7K). Whereas 7K probably originates
      nonenzymically, 27OH arises by the action of sterol 27-hydroxylase, a cytochrome 
      P450 enzyme expressed at particularly high levels in the macrophage and proposed 
      to represent an important pathway by which macrophages eliminate excess
      cholesterol. We hypothesized and here show that 27-hydroxylated 7-ketocholesterol
      (270H-7K) is present in human lesions, probably generated by the action of sterol
      27-hydroxylase on 7K. Moreover, [(3)H]27OH-7K was produced by human
      monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) supplied with [(3)H]7K but not in HMDMs from
      a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) shown to have a
      splice-junction mutation of sterol 27-hydroxylase. Whereas [(3)H]27OH-7K was
      predominantly secreted into the medium, [(3)H]-27OH formed from
      [(3)H]-cholesterol was mostly cell-associated. The majority of supplied [(3)H]7K 
      was metabolized beyond 27OH-7K to aqueous-soluble products (apparently bile acids
      derived from the sterol 27-hydroxylase pathway). Metabolism to aqueous-soluble
      products was ablated by a sterol 27-hydroxylase inhibitor and absent in CTX
      cells. Sterol 27-hydroxylase therefore appears to represent an important pathway 
      by which macrophages eliminate not only cholesterol but also oxysterols such as
      7K. The fact that 7K (and cholesterol) still accumulates in lesions and foam
      cells indicates that this pathway may be perturbed in atherosclerosis and affords
      a new opportunity for the development of therapeutic strategies to regress
      atherosclerotic lesions.

TI  - Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency: a rare cause of xanthomas in
      normocholesterolemic humans.
PG  - 180-3
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is characterized by the accumulation of
      cholestanol and cholesterol in xanthomas and brain causing a number of severe
      symptoms. More than 20 different mutations have been identified in the gene
      encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase. Defects in the gene lead to reduced bile acid
      biosynthesis, with accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxylated intermediates, one of
      which is a precursor to cholestanol. The disease can be treated successfully with
      chenodeoxycholic acid, which reduces the upregulation of cholesterol 7
      alpha-hydroxylase and, therefore, the formation of cholestanol. Disruption of the
      gene encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase in mice does not have the same metabolic
      consequences as in humans.

TI  - Clinical and molecular genetic characteristics of patients with cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 908-19
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease caused by a
      deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP 27), due to
      mutations in its gene. In this study we report on mutations in 58 patients with
      CTX out of 32 unrelated families. Eight of these were novel mutations, two of
      which were found together with two already known pathogenic mutations. Twelve
      mutations found in this patient group have been described in the literature. In
      the patients from 31 families, mutations were found in both alleles. In the
      literature, 28 mutations in 67 patients with CTX out of 44 families have been
      described. Pooling our patient group and the patients from the literature
      together, 37 different mutations in 125 patients out of 74 families were
      obtained. Identical mutations have been found in families from different ethnic
      backgrounds. In 41% of all the patients, CYP 27 gene mutations are found in the
      region of exons 6-8. This region encodes for adrenodoxin and haem binding sites
      of the protein. Of these 125 patients, a genotype-phenotype analysis was done for
      79 homozygous patients harbouring 23 different mutations, out of 45 families. The
      patients with compound heterozygous mutations were left out of the
      genotype-phenotype analysis. The genotype-phenotype analysis did not reveal any
      correlation.

TI  - Presence of diarrhea and absence of tendon xanthomas in patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 520-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive
      disorder of bile acid synthesis. A diagnosis of CTX should be considered in
      patients with premature bilateral cataracts, intractable diarrhea, neurological
      signs and symptoms, and tendon xanthomas, especially in the Achilles tendons. The
      prevalence of these signs and symptoms increases with age. OBJECTIVES: To
      investigate signs and symptoms, age at onset, and age at diagnosis in 32 patients
      with biochemically and genetically confirmed CTX, and to compare this clinical
      spectrum with reports in the literature. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of
      records of all patients with CTX at our hospital (27 adults and 5 children).
      After a MEDLINE search in the English, French, and German literature, 181
      patients with CTX (165 adults and 16 children) were identified worldwide.
      RESULTS: Of our 32 patients with CTX, 31 (97%) had cataracts and neurological
      signs and symptoms, predominantly pyramidal signs (26 [81%]); 21 (66%) had low
      intelligence and 18 (56%) had cerebellar signs. Only 13 (41%) had visible or
      palpable tendon xanthomas at the time of diagnosis. In total, 16 patients (50%)
      had chronic, intractable diarrhea that started in childhood. These findings were 
      in contrast with the literature, where tendon xanthomas were reported in 89% and 
      diarrhea in only 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that CTX is underdiagnosed
      worldwide. We recommend that the presence of 2 of the 4 clinical hallmarks of CTX
      prompt thorough metabolic screening, including determination of urine bile
      alcohol excretion and serum cholestanol level, because CTX is a treatable
      disease.

      analysis.
PG  - 110-3
AB  - A case of sudden death of a 52-year-old mentally retarded Caucasian male is
      described where the rectal temperature was 43.4 degrees C 3 h postmortem. The
      autopsy revealed cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare hereditary
      metabolic disorder, as the primary disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by
      postmortem identification of two mutations (compound heterozygosity for R237X and
      IVS6+1G-->A) in the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene. Both mutations have
      already been described in patients with CTX and can be considered the most likely
      cause of the disease. The pathomechanism of the excessive hyperthermia could not 
      be completely elucidated.

TI  - Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and other sterol disorders among Finns with
      developmental disabilities.
PG  - 457-67
AB  - Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an inherited disorder of cholesterol
      metabolism in which 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterols are accumulated in blood and
      tissues. Diagnosis of SLOS and other disorders in cholesterol metabolism (eg,
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, phytosterolemia, desmosterolosis, and X-linked
      dominant Conradi-Hunermann-Happle syndrome) can be performed by gas-liquid
      chromatographic analysis of serum sterols. To elucidate their involvement in
      developmental disability, we evaluated serum sterols in two study groups:
      developmentally disabled subjects in long-term care (N = 322) and newborns and
      young children (N = 49) with features of SLOS in the Finnish population of 5
      million. Only 1 SLOS case (type II) was found from among the 49 children. Seven
      additional adult cases (type I) with a wide range of clinical features and the
      serum sterol abnormalities characteristic of SLOS were detected from among the
      developmentally disabled subjects. The frequency of SLOS in the latter group was 
      relatively high (7 in 322). No other hereditary sterol disorders were found, but 
      two subgroups with low serum cholesterol precursor sterols and high serum plant
      sterols were identified. Several subjects, including the 7 SLOS patients, used
      ample medication and had abnormalities in serum sterol concentrations. Thus,
      among the subjects taking melperone, a high serum delta8-cholestenol level
      suggests an interference by the drug with cholesterol synthesis. Our results
      emphasize the importance of analyzing the serum sterols of developmentally

TI  - Mutation of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) results in truncation of mRNA 
      expressed in leucocytes in a Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 675-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was
      investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27).
      The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts,
      prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple
      and rapid technique. METHODS: An alteration in CYP27 of the proband was searched 
      for by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism
      (PCR-SSCP) analysis and subsequent sequencing. Samples of RNA were subjected to
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and the product of the proband was amplified
      with nested primers and sequenced. RESULTS: A homozygous G to A transition at the
      5' end of intron 7 was detected in the patient. In RT-PCR analysis, only a
      truncated transcript was detected in the patient, whereas both normal and
      truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings. The sequencing of the
      patient's cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8.
      CONCLUSION: The mutation at splice donor site and the truncation of mRNA were
      identical with those of a recently reported Italian patient, although different
      in symptomatology. The application of blood leucocytes can be a simple technique 
      on analysing a constructive abnormality of CYP27 mRNA.

TI  - Anomalous enantioselectivity in the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction
      of 24-nor-5beta-cholest-23-ene-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol: synthesis of
      substrates for studies of cholesterol side-chain oxidation.
PG  - 395-405
AB  - Recently we described a block in bile acid synthesis in cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX), a lipid storage disease related to an inborn error of bile
      acid metabolism. In this disease a defect in hepatic microsomal (24S)
      hydroxylation blocks the transformation of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol into (24S)
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24,25- pentol and cholic acid.
      Mitochondrial cholesterol 27-hydroxylation has also been reported to be abnormal 
      in CTX subjects, but the relative importance of the enzymatic defect in this
      alternative microsomal pathway (namely, the 24S hydroxylation of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,25-tetrol relative to the abnormality in 
      mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase) has not been established in CTX. To delineate the
      sequence of side-chain hydroxylations and the enzymatic block in bile acid
      synthesis, we synthesized the (23R and 23S)
      24-nor-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,23,25-pentols utilizing a modified
      Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction on
      24-nor-5beta-cholest-23-ene-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-triol, a C26 analog of the
      naturally occurring C27 bile alcohol,
      5beta-cholest-24-ene-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol . Stereospecific conversion of
      the unsaturated 24-nor triol to the corresponding chiral compounds (23R and 23S),
      24-nor-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,23 ,25-pentols, was quantitative.
      However, conversion of the unsaturated 24-nor triol to the chiral nor-pentols had
      absolute stereochemistry opposite to the products predicted by the Sharpless
      steric model. The absolute configurations and enantiomeric excess of the C26
      nor-pentols and the C27 pentols (synthesized from
      5beta-cholest-24-ene-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol for comparison) were confirmed
      by nuclear magnetic resonance and lanthanide-induced circular dichroism Cotton
      effect measurements. These results may contribute to a better understanding of
      the role of the 24S-hydroxylation vs. 27-hydroxylation step in cholic acid
      biosynthesis.

TI  - Spinal xanthomatosis: a variant of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1589-95
AB  - We describe seven Dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive,
      mainly spinal cord syndrome that remained for many years the sole expression of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities
      in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Post-mortem examination of 
      one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns. An array of
      genotypes was found in these patients. We conclude that 'spinal xanthomatosis' is
      a clinical and radiological separate entity of CTX that should be included in the
      differential diagnosis of 'chronic myelopathy'.

TI  - Mutations producing premature termination of translation and an amino acid
      substitution in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene cause cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis associated with parkinsonism.
PG  - 195-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mutational analysis of the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) gene was
      performed on three patients from two Japanese families who had cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) associated with parkinsonism. METHODS: Clinical evaluations, 
      brain MRI studies, and laboratory analyses were completed on the three patients. 
      The CYP27 gene was analysed for mutations by PCR amplification of gene segments
      followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Two different, homozygous mutations were 
      identified in these families. One is a novel transition, substituting T for G at 
      Glu162 (GAG) resulting in a stop codon (TAG). The other is also a transition,
      substituting T for C at Arg441 (CGG) resulting in Trp (TGG). The second is
      located in two amino acids ahead of the heme ligand binding site (Cys443) of the 
      protein likely rendering it non-functional. It is the most common CTX mutation in
      Japanese patients. CONCLUSIONS: CTX with parkinsonism is caused by mutations with
      a severe impact on enzyme function. The two mutations described here are likely
      to cause loss of function because they are chain terminating or affect an
      essential site in the protein.

TI  - Cholestanol induces apoptosis of cerebellar neuronal cells.
PG  - 198-203
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a hereditary lipid storage disease
      characterized by hyper-cholestanolemia, cerebellar ataxia, xanthoma, and
      cataract. We hypothesized that cholestanol in serum of CTX patients might induce 
      neuronal cell death in the cerebellum and eventually lead to cerebellar ataxia.
      To gain support for this hypothesis we developed hyper-cholestanolemia rats by
      feeding cholestanol. Neuronal cells, especially Purkinje cells in the cerebellum 
      were stained by Sudan black B only in the cholestanol-fed rats, indicating the
      deposit of cholestanol in cerebellum. To examine effects of cholestanol in vitro,
      cerebellar neuronal cells were cultured with cholestanol. The cholestanol
      concentration increased and the viability decreased in cells cultured with
      cholestanol. Apoptosis was evident in cells cultured with cholestanol more
      frequently than in control cells, determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
      transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method. As activities of
      interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and CPP32 protease were increased in
      cells cultured with cholestanol, all these data taken together suggest that
      cholestanol induced apoptosis of cerebellar neuronal cells. Our observations may 
      explain the mechanism of cerebellar ataxia of CTX patients.

TI  - Effect of simvastatin in addition to chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 233-8
AB  - The effects of combination therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and
      simvastatin on serum cholestanol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and 
      lathosterol levels were investigated in seven adult patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) who were on long-term treatment with CDCA.
      The patients were treated with a combination of CDCA 750 mg daily and an
      increasing dose of simvastatin from 10 mg to 40 mg daily for a period of 6
      months. We found a significant effect of this combination therapy compared with
      CDCA alone in terms of decreasing the serum cholestanol and LDL cholesterol
      levels, particularly with a daily dose of 40 mg simvastatin. The mean cholestanol
      level decreased from 9.27 micromol/L (baseline) to 6.69 micromol/L (40 mg
      simvastatin), while the mean LDL cholesterol level decreased from 5.08 mmol/L
      (baseline) to 3.04 mmol/L (40 mg simvastatin). No side effects were reported, and
      there were no effects on the clinical condition, cerebral magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), visual evoked potentials, and electroencephalographic features. We
      conclude that a combination of 750 mg CDCA and 40 mg simvastatin daily is
      effective to further reduce serum cholestanol, LDL cholesterol, and lathosterol
      in adult CTX patients treated with long-term CDCA. Whether this combination
      treatment will be effective for the long-term prevention of neurological
      deterioration and atherosclerosis remains to be established.

      particular reference to biochemical and pathological pulmonary disorders. To
      date, few reports discuss the pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders of CTX
      patients. This study is the first investigation of such pulmonary disorders. All 
      5 patients had no pulmonary symptoms and no disturbances on radiological studies 
      and pulmonary function tests. However, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids,
      many cells with cruciform reflexes, which is characteristic of intracellular
      sterol accumulation, were found under phase contrast microscopy. Biochemically,
      cholestanol was found to be increased in the BAL fluid as well as in serum.
      Pathological findings of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) samples disclosed
      foamy macrophages and small granulomas in alveolar septa. In conclusion, the lung
      was apparently involved in CTX, and the lesions were characterized with the
      accumulation of foamy and giant cells with a high concentration of cholestanol,
      which likely results in the formation of foreign body granulomas.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: evidence of lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial 
      septum.
PG  - 723-6
AB  - Premature atherosclerosis and cardiac complications have been reported among the 
      systemic manifestations of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare bile acid
      disorder with predominantly neurological features. In some cases, myocardial
      infarction has been the cause of sudden death. We examined nine CTX patients to
      determine whether they also had clinical or subclinical signs of cardiovascular
      disorders. In four of them, transthoracic echocardiography showed thickening of
      the interatrial septum compatible with lipomatous hypertrophy. The unexpected
      association of the two abnormalities is unlikely to be coincidental and suggests 
      that careful cardiac examination should be considered, even in the absence of
      clinical manifestations.

TI  - A novel Arg362Ser mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27): its effects
      on pre-mRNA splicing and enzyme activity.
PG  - 15050-6
AB  - A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27) was identified 
      by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis (CTX). The mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding
      residue 362Arg to 362Ser (CGT 362Arg to AGT 362Ser), and was responsible for
      deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by expression of
      mutant cDNA into COS-1 cells. Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of
      CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52.5% of the normal level. As the
      mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (-2 position of exon
      6-intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may
      partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative
      splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient.
      Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into COS-1
      cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species
      alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5' splice site 88 bp upstream from 
      the 3' end of exon 6. Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the
      penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency
      in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative
      pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report
      regarding effects on pre-mRNA splicing of a mutation at the -2 position of a 5'
      splice site.

      associated with the disease. We report the identification of three types of
      mutations (Arg441Trp, Arg372Gln, and Arg441Gln) in the CYP27 gene in five
      patients with suspected CTX from four unrelated families by restriction

TI  - Markedly reduced bile acid synthesis but maintained levels of cholesterol and

PG  - 14805-12
AB  - Sterol 27-hydroxylase is important for the degradation of the steroid side chain 
      in conversion of cholesterol into bile acids and has been ascribed a regulatory
      role in cholesterol homeostasis. Its deficiency causes the autosomal recessive
      disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), characterized by progressive
      dementia, xanthomatosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Mice with a disrupted
      cyp27 (cyp27(-/-)) had normal plasma levels of cholesterol, retinol, tocopherol, 
      and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Excretion of fecal bile acids was decreased (<20% of
      normal), and formation of bile acids from tritium-labeled
      7alpha-hydroxycholesterol was less than 15% of normal. Compensatory up-regulation
      of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase
      (9- and 2-3-fold increases in mRNA levels, respectively) was found. No
      CTX-related pathological abnormalities were observed. In CTX, there is an
      increased formation of 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols and cholestanol. In bile and
      feces of the cyp27(-/-) mice only traces of bile alcohols were found, and there
      was no cholestanol accumulation. It is evident that sterol 27-hydroxylase is more
      important for bile acid synthesis in mice than in humans. The results do not
      support the contention that 27-hydroxylated steroids are critical for maintenance
      of cholesterol homeostasis or levels of vitamin D metabolites in the circulation.

TI  - Treatment and follow-up of children with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 313-6
AB  - The clinical spectrum and the effects of treatment over a period of 5 years in
      five children with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) are described. In all
      children biochemical, neuroradiological, and neurophysiological studies were
      done. CTX was diagnosed and effects of therapy were evaluated by determination of
      the serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (CCR) and the urinary excretion of bile
      alcohols. All children were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg/day) in 
      three divided oral doses. Diarrhoea and juvenile cataract were the main clinical 
      features. Psychomotor retardation, pyramidal and cerebellar signs were also
      found. After starting treatment, biochemical abnormalities normalized and
      diarrhoea disappeared. After 1 year of therapy there was no further delay in
      motor development, and in three children the intelligence quotient improved. EEG 
      abnormalities disappeared. After 5 years of therapy the children are in a stable 
      clinical condition. CONCLUSION: The clinical, biochemical and neurophysiological 
      abnormalities in five children with CTX showed a remarkable improvement after
      starting treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. The early diagnosis of CTX and the
      start of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid has prevented neurological
      deterioration for a period of 5 years.

TI  - Silent nucleotide substitution in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) leads
      to alternative pre-mRNA splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site at the
      mutant codon in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients.
PG  - 4420-8
AB  - A functionally silent nucleotide substitution of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene
      (CYP 27), identified in two families with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX),
      was confirmed to cause alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene. Full-length
      RT-PCR analysis of the CYP 27 gene in a patient from one of the CTX families
      revealed one major and an additional faint band. Sequence analysis of the cloned 
      RT-PCR product showed three species of cDNA: 3' terminal 13 bp of exon 2 deleted 
      cDNA, exon 2 skipped cDNA, and full-length cDNA with a functionally silent G to T
      mutation at codon 112 (GGG 112Gly to GGT 112Gly). Only a single base change was
      identified by genomic DNA sequence analysis of the CYP 27 gene in the patient: T 
      replaced G at the third position of codon 112, 13 bp upstream from the 3'
      terminus of exon 2. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the
      mutation, confirmed that this silent mutation resulted in alternative pre-mRNA
      splicing by activating a cryptic 5' splice site around the mutant codon. The
      mutation was also identified in two patients from another CTX family, with a
      compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at codon 372, a mutation
      reported previously by our group. The results elucidate a novel molecular basis
      for the CTX and suggest the significance of a silent nucleotide substitution with
      regard to pre-RNA splicing.

TI  - Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) caused
      by a G to A mutation at the last nucleotide of exon 6 in a patient with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
PG  - 509-17
AB  - A recently identified G to A mutation at the last nucleotide of exon 6 of the
      sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP 27) in a patient with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) was shown here to cause alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the 
      gene. Northern blot analysis of the patient's RNA revealed a broadened band in
      the human CYP 27 mRNA region compared to that of the normal sample, indicating
      that there may exist differently spliced mRNA species in the patient. RT-PCR
      produced three fragments in the patient, one was full-length size and the other
      two were of smaller sizes. Sequence analysis confirmed that the nucleotide of the
      full-length size was identical to that of the normal full-length cDNA, except for
      the G to A mutation at codon 362, which corresponds to the last nucleotide of
      exon 6. One of the smaller size species lacked exon 6 and the other was absent
      from the 3' terminal 88 bp of exon 6 due to the use of an activated cryptic 5'
      splice site in exon 6. The correctly spliced mRNA harbouring the G to A mutation 
      was responsible for the deficiency of the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as
      confirmed by transfection experiment. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with
      or without the mutation, showed that correctly spliced mRNA was observed in the
      normal minigene while the mutant minigene was differently spliced. This is the
      first report of a G to A substitution at the last nucleotide of an exon resulting
      in both normal and abnormal pre-mRNA splicings, including exon skipping and
      activating of a coding region cryptic 5' splice site. The results reveal a new
      molecular basis for the CTX and provide information on aberrant splicing of
      pre-mRNA in multi-exon genes.

TI  - Four novel mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in Italian patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 2322-34
AB  - We report the characterization of eight mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase gene
      (CYP27) in five Italian patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, who were
      found to be compound heterozygotes. Four mutations (C --> T at nt 45 of exon 4,
      G(+1) --> A in intron 6, G(+5) --> T in intron 7, and G(-1) --> A in intron 7)
      are novel. The C --> T at nt 45 of exon 4 converts the arginine codon into a stop
      codon thus generating a truncated protein of 198 amino acids. The three splice
      site mutations reduced the content of CYP27 mRNA in skin fibroblasts to very low 
      or undetectable levels and generated minute amounts of abnormal mRNAs. The G(+1) 
      --> A transition in intron 6 produced three abnormal mRNAs. In the first, the 5' 
      half of exon 6 joins to exon 7, skipping 89 bp of exon 6, and in the second, exon
      5 joins directly to exon 7. The predicted translation products of these mRNAs are
      truncated proteins. In the third abnormal mRNA, exon 5 joins to exon 8 with an
      in-frame deletion of 246 bp. The G(+5) --> T transversion in intron 7 generates a
      single abnormal mRNA in which exon 6 joins directly to exon 8, with a frameshift 
      and a premature stop codon. In the G(-1) --> A transition in intron 7, two mRNAs 
      are generated. In the first, the retention of the whole intron 7 causes a
      frameshift and a premature stop codon; in the second, the joining of exon 7 to
      exon 8 is associated with an in-frame deletion of the first 6 nucleotides. All
      these novel mutations are predicted to produce structurally abnormal enzymatic
      proteins with no measurable biological activity.

TI  - Elimination of cholesterol in macrophages and endothelial cells by the sterol
      27-hydroxylase mechanism. Comparison with high density lipoprotein-mediated
      reverse cholesterol transport.
PG  - 26253-61
AB  - Cultured macrophages and endothelial cells have been reported to secrete
      27-oxygenated metabolites of cholesterol. This mechanism was compared with the
      classical high density lipoprotein (HDL)-dependent reverse cholesterol transport.
      Under standard conditions, macrophage preparations had considerably higher
      capacity to secrete 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid
      than had endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Western blotting showed that lung
      macrophages contained the most sterol 27-hydroxylase protein of the cells tested.
      The relative amounts of 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid produced by the
      macrophages were also highest. Macrophages derived from monocytes of patients
      with sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency did not secrete 27-oxygenated products,
      demonstrating that sterol 27-hydroxylase is the critical enzyme for the
      conversion of cholesterol into the 27-oxygenated steroids. That sterol
      27-hydroxylase is responsible not only for 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol but
      also for the further oxidation of this steroid into 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic 
      acid was shown with use of tritium-labeled 27-hydroxycholesterol and an inhibitor
      of sterol 27-hydroxylase. Secretion of 27-oxygenated products by the cultured
      macrophages as well as the ratio between the alcohol and the acid appeared to be 
      dependent upon total 27-hydroxylase activity, the availability of substrate
      cholesterol, and the presence of an acceptor for 27-hydroxycholesterol in the
      medium. With albumin as extracellular acceptor, the major secreted product was
      3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid. Under such conditions, secretion of labeled
      27-oxygenated products was higher than that of labeled cholesterol from lung
      alveolar macrophages preloaded with [4-14C]cholesterol. With HDL as acceptor,
      27-hydroxycholesterol was the major secreted product, and the total secretion of 
      labeled 27-oxygenated products was only about 10% of that of labeled cholesterol.
      Thus, 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol may compete for HDL-mediated efflux
      from the cells. The results support the contention that the sterol
      27-hydroxylase-mediated elimination of cholesterol is more important in
      macrophages than in endothelial cells. This mechanism may be an alternative
      and/or a complement to the classical HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport
      in macrophages, in particular when the concentration of HDL is low.

TI  - Novel homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase
      gene (CYP27) cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in three Japanese patients from
      two unrelated families.
PG  - 870-9
AB  - The autosomal recessively inherited cholesterol metabolic disease,
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), is caused by mutations in the sterol
      27-hydroxylase gene. Three Japanese CTX patients from two unrelated families were
      studied genetically. By DNA sequence analysis a novel mutation of A for G
      substitution at amino acid position 372 (CGG 372Arg to CAG 372Gln) was identified
      in one of the CTX families. The mutation was also found in two patients from the 
      other family, with a compound heterozygous pattern of A for G substitution at
      amino acid position 441 (CGG 441Arg to CAG 441Gln). The latter mutation was the
      same as previously reported by our group (J. Lipid Res. 1994. 35: 1031-1039). As 
      the two mutations changed the restriction enzyme sites, rapid screening methods
      were developed for the detection of the carriers. Transfection of the two mutant 
      cDNAs into COS cells resulted in markedly reduced sterol 27-hydroxylase activity.
      These results indicate that the two mutations are responsible for the deficiency 
      of the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in these patients. The features of
      mutations identified till now in Japanese CTX patients are also reviewed.

TI  - Rapid hydrogenation of unsaturated sterols and bile alcohols using microwaves.
PG  - 451-4
AB  - This paper describes an operationally simple, rapid hydrogenation of unsaturated 
      sterols and bile alcohols in a domestic microwave oven. This has been achieved by
      the addition of catalytic amounts of Pd/C in methylene chloride/propylene glycol 
      solvents in the presence of ammonium formate followed by microwave irradiation.
      It is suggested that this methodology will be helpful in the identification of
      saturated and unsaturated sterols with different side-chain structures in rare
      diseases: sitosterolemia, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), as well as
      atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. Sterols, such as cholesterol, campesterol,

      of the intermediate, 3 alpha, 7 beta, 12
      alpha-triformyloxy-24-oxo-25-diazo-25-homo-5 beta-cholane is described. The
      reaction sequence involved treating the intermediate, alpha-diazoketone in
      methanol with 3% AgNO3 or Ag2O, anhydrous Na2CO3, Na2S2O/H2O resulting in the
      formation of homoursocholic acid in high yield. Esterification of the
      homoursocholic acid in methanol containing a catalytic amount of methanesulfonic 
      acid under microwave irradiation conditions gave methyl homourscholate. The
      subsequent treatment of methyl homoursocholate with methyl magnesium iodide
      provided 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol in 88% yield. The
      products and synthetic intermediates prepared in these studies were fully
      characterized by the results of 1D and 2D NMR, and high-resolution mass spectral 
      studies. These studies will help in further investigation of the defect of cholic
      acid biosynthesis in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) as well
      as other inborn errors of bile acid metabolism.

TI  - Rehabilitation of balance in two patients with cerebellar dysfunction.
PG  - 534-52
AB  - The treatment of two patients with cerebellar dysfunction is described. One
      patient was a 36-year-old woman with a 7-month history of dizziness and
      unsteadiness following surgical resection of a recurrent pilocystic astrocytoma
      located in the cerebellar vermis. The other patient was a 48-year-old man with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and diffuse cerebellar atrophy, and a
      10-year history of progressive gait and balance difficulties. Each patient was
      treated with a 6-week course of physical therapy that emphasized the practice of 
      activities that challenged stability. The patient with the cerebellar tumor
      resection also performed eye-head coordination exercises. Each patient had weekly
      therapy and performed selected balance retraining exercises on a daily basis at
      home. Measurements taken before and after treatment for each patient included
      self-perception of symptoms, clinical balance tests, and stability during
      selected standing and gait activities; for the patient with the cerebellar tumor 
      resection, vestibular function tests and posturography were also performed. Both 
      patients reported improvements in symptoms and demonstrated similar improvements 
      on several kinematic indicators of stability during gait. The patient with the
      cerebellar tumor resection improved on posturography following treatment, whereas
      the patient with CTX improved on clinical balance tests. This case report
      describes two individualized treatment programs and documents functional
      improvements in two patients with different etiologies, durations, and clinical
      presentations of cerebellar dysfunction. The outcomes suggest that patients with 
      cerebellar lesions, acute or chronic, may be able to learn to improve their
      postural stability.

PG  - 225-7
AB  - We evaluated the therapeutic effect of combined therapy with chenodeoxycholic
      acid, calcium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate on long-standing osteoporsis in
      three siblings (two women and one man, aged 30-38 yr) with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX). The evaluation was based on the measurement of bone mineral 
      density (BMD) before and after 3 years of combined therapy. Clinically, the
      therapeutic effect was quite limited (almost no change in BMD values), and did
      not parallel the marked decrease in serum cholestanol level (normalization of
      serum levels). While the reason for the therapeutic failure in our patients is
      not known, it is possible that delay in starting treatment may have been a
      factor. Measurement of BMD for evaluation of therapeutic effect in long-standing 
      osteoporosis in CTX patients is of little practical value.

TI  - A novel mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene of a Pakistani family with
      autosomal recessive cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 258-60
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of
      lipid storage with prominent neurologic features. The disease is associated with 
      mutations in CYP27, which encodes mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase, an enzyme 
      that catalyzes the oxidation of sterol intermediates during bile acid synthesis. 
      The loss of this enzyme results in accumulation of cholestanol in the nervous
      system and other tissues. Six different mutations have been previously described 
      in CTX. We analyzed a Pakistani family, which included four affected individuals 
      with clinical characteristics of CTX, for mutations in CYP27. The exons of CYP27 
      in the family DNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed 
      for mutations by band shifts (single stranded conformational polymorphism [SSCP])
      and DNA sequencing. The PCR product for exon 4 showed an SSCP change in this
      family. The DNA of affected individuals showed an abnormal mobility pattern
      interpreted as homozygous for the mutation. One non-affected sibling was
      homozygous for the normal migrating pattern, whereas the parents and another
      non-affected sibling were heterozygous. The sequence of exon 4 of affected
      individuals showed a substitution of C to T in codon 237, thus substituting
      arginine to a stop codon. This mutation would terminate the translation, which
      may result in a protein half the size of the wild type rendering it practically
      inactive.

TI  - [Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: utility of nuclear magnetic resonance image in
      the follow-up and response to treatment].
PG  - 1535-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an inherited autosomal recessive 
      lipid storage disease. Clinical features include tendon xanthomas, premature
      cataracts and progressive neurologic dysfunctions. Substantial elevation of serum
      cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols and their precursors establishes the
      diagnosis. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) is useful for diagnosis of cerebral and
      tendinous lesions. Treatment with chanodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) has been reported 
      to correct biochemical abnormalities and to arrest and possibility to reverse the
      progression of the neurologic symptoms in some patients. CLINICAL CASE: We
      present the case of a 34-year-old male suffering from ataxia and enlargement of
      both Achilles tendons suggestive of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The findings 
      of elevated serum cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols confirmed clinical
      suspicious. Cranial and tendinous MRI evidenced cerebral, cerebellar, medullar
      and tendinous lesions. The patient received treatment with CDCA for 42 months
      (750 mg/day), with improvement in neurologic symptoms, correction of analytical
      parameters and cerebellar and medullar lesions at MRI. CONCLUSION: In
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, treatment with CDCA reduces serum cholestanol and
      arrest neurologic symptoms progression. In accordance with clinical evolution and
      analytical normalization, we point out he utility of MRI in the surveillance and 
      response to treatment with CDCA.

      termination codon. Patient A was homozygous for the mutation, whereas patient B
      was compound heterozygous, a C-->T transition also being found in exon 6 at

TI  - Genetic analysis of a Japanese cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis family:
      identification of a novel mutation in the adrenodoxin binding region of the CYP
      27 gene.
PG  - 119-26
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), an autosomal recessive lipid-storage
      hereditary disorder, is caused by mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene
      (CYP 27). A 24-year-old female Japanese CTX patient and her parents were studied 
      for a CYP 27 mutation. Multiple xanthomas were the main complaint of the patient 
      and plasma cholestanol level was markedly elevated. Sterol analysis of a xanthoma
      biopsy confirmed cholesterol and cholestanol deposition, and the cholestanol
      accounted for 8.1% of the total sterols. Sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in
      fibroblasts derived from the patient was undetectable, while the activities in
      fibroblasts from her mother and father were 54% and 41% of the normal level,
      respectively. Direct sequence analysis showed a missense mutation of A for G
      substitution in the CYP 27 gene at codon 362 (CGT 362Arg to CAT 362His) with a
      homozygous pattern in the patient, and a heterozygous pattern in the parents. The
      mutation, which eliminates a normal HgaI endonuclease site at position 1195 of
      the cDNA and is located at the adrenodoxin binding region of the gene, is most
      probably responsible for the decreased sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in this
      Japanese CTX family. The combined data strongly support that the primary
      enzymatic defect in CTX is the disruption of sterol 27-hydroxylase and that the
      disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait.

      19-positions of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids have been found from the
      meconium, neonatal bile, blood and urine, and amniotic fluid and pregnant urine
      by GC-MS analysis. These hydroxylated bile acids and their conjugates were
      synthesized as their references from the corresponding usual bile acids as
      starting materials, and the simultaneous and high performance analytical methods 
      were developed by GC-MS, HPLC and enzyme immunoassay. The above mentioned unusual
      bile acids were identified and determined in significant amounts of the total
      bile acids in the biological fluids from neonates and pregnant women, but not
      from normal adults. We, therefore, proposed that they should be called as "fetal 
      bile acids". Application of the developed methods was performed for the studies
      on the dynamic profile of fetal bile acids in developing fetus and neonates, and 
      the clinical diagnosis of the hepatobiliary diseases of infants and congenital
      bile acid biosynthetic disorders, Zellweger syndrome, celebrotendinus
      xanthomatosis, 3-oxo-delta 4-steroid 5 beta-reductase deficiency and congenital
      biliary atresia. Analyses of steroidal hormones, equine estrogens and
      18-hydroxycortisol were also described.

TI  - Urinary excretion of mevalonic acid as an indicator of cholesterol synthesis.
PG  - 2193-201
AB  - Urinary excretion of mevalonic acid was investigated as an indicator of
      cholesterol synthesis. In normolipemic volunteers, excretion of mevalonic acid
      averaged 3.51 +/- 0.59 (SD) micrograms/kg x day1; (n = 24) and was not different 
      from patients with hypercholesterolemia (3.30 +/- 0.92 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 
      24). In patients with cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, the excretion was
      significantly higher (8.55 +/- 1.92 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 6, P < 0.001) but
      comparable to volunteers treated with cholestyramine (6.69 +/- 2.6 micrograms/kg 
      x day1; n = 5). A significant correlation was found between 24-h excretion of
      mevalonic acid and cholesterol synthesis (r = 0.835; n = 35; P < 0.001). The
      coefficient of variation of excretion of mevalonic acid during 3 consecutive days
      was small (9.8%; n = 7). However, urinary output of mevalonic acid was
      significantly higher during the night (164 +/- 14 micrograms/12-h) than during
      the day (129 +/- 9 micrograms/12-h; n = 11; P < 0.05). In patients treated with
      simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 6 weeks, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in
      a morning urine sample decreased significantly compared to pretreatment values
      (110 +/- 25 micrograms/g vs. 66 +/- 25 micrograms/g; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the
      ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample correlated with
      the ratio from the 24-h collection period (r = 0.714; n = 34; P < 0.001). The
      results indicate that the analysis of urinary mevalonic acid, either in 24-h
      collection or in a single morning sample, is an attractive method for evaluation 
      of long and very short term changes of the rates of cholesterol synthesis.

TI  - Chronic diarrhoea as a dominating symptom in two children with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 932-6
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe diarrhoea as a dominating symptom of 
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a lipid storage disease, and investigate
      its cause. Two children with chronic diarrhoea as the dominating symptom of CTX
      are presented. Before and after therapy with orally administered chenodeoxycholic
      acid (15 mg kg-1 24 h, in three divided doses) bile alcohol excretion in urine,
      serum cholestanol level, serum bile acid patterns and faecal bile acids were
      measured. All routine gastro-intestinal investigations before therapy were
      normal. Diarrhoea ceased immediately after starting treatment with
      chenodeoxycholic acid. Abnormal bile alcohol excretion in urine decreased rapidly
      during the first days and elevated serum cholestanol level normalized in 2 years.
      We postulate the presence of bile alcohols in the lumen of the gut as most likely
      cause for diarrhoea in CTX, since the rapid decrease of bile alcohol excretion is
      associated with prompt cessation of diarrhoea after starting treatment with
      chenodeoxycholic acid.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis caused by two new mutations of the
      sterol-27-hydroxylase gene that disrupt mRNA splicing.
PG  - 1459-67
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an inherited sterol storage disease
      associated with the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in various
      tissues. CTX is caused by a deficiency of sterol-27-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial 
      enzyme that oxidizes the side chain of cholesterol in the pathway leading to the 
      formation of bile acids. In the present study we report two mutations of
      sterol-27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27 gene) found in Italian CTX patients. Proband
      T.C. is homozygous for a G-->A transition at the first nucleotide of intron 7.
      This mutation causes the formation of minute amounts of an abnormal mRNA, in
      which exon 6 joins directly to exon 8 with the skipping of exon 7. The exon
      6-exon 8 junction results in a frame shift, downstream from the codon for Arg362,
      which generates a string of 28 novel amino acids preceding a premature
      termination codon. Proband C.U. is homozygous for a G-->C transversion at the
      last nucleotide of exon 3. This mutation, which changes the consensus sequence of
      the 5' donor splice site, is associated with barely detectable levels of
      sterol-27-hydroxylase mRNA, of normal size, in proband fibroblasts. As both
      mutations change the sites for two restriction enzymes, rapid methods were
      devised for the identification of the healthy carriers among the probands' family
      members and for the screening of these mutations in other CTX patients.

      UV-absorbing bile alcohol derivatives. Bile alcohols were treated with 3
      alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to form the corresponding 3-keto bile
      alcohols. The 3-keto bile alcohols produced were converted to the
      2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives, separated using a Nova-Pak Phenyl column,
      and monitored at 364 nm. The separation of stereoisomers related to the
      configuration of hydroxyl groups on the side chain of the bile alcohols, which
      was not achieved by gas chromatography, could also be accomplished.

      xanthomatosis (CTX) based on the high serum cholestanol level and diminished
      enzymatic activity of 27-hydroxylase of fibroblasts from her skin. Her clinical
      presentation was atypical regarding the presence of hemiparkinsonism and absence 
      of apparent cataract, dementia, and cerebellar ataxia. Although MRI studies could
      not detect any abnormality in the basal ganglia or midbrain, PET analysis using
      [18F]-6-fluoro-L-dopa revealed reduced uptake of dopamine into the putamen,
      suggesting the impairment of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas mimicking
      Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome: a case report.
PG  - 582-5
AB  - A 39 year old patient with cerebellar signs, juvenile cataracts, and dull normal 
      intelligence had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas,
      diagnosed previously as Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome. Cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis was proved by a greatly increased excretion of bile alcohols in the
      patient's urine. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a sterol storage disorder due 
      to an autosomal recessive inherited defect of sterol 27-hydroxylase characterised
      by high cholestanol concentration in multiple tissues. If tendon xanthomas are
      not present, a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis will often not be
      made, unless biochemical tests are performed. The clinical features of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomas strongly resembles Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome.
      Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome is a autosomal recessive disorder characterised by
      the triad cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, and mental retardation.
      Although a late onset after the first decade of life favours cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis as the underlying disease, a definite distinction between
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas and Marinesco-Sjoegren
      syndrome based on clinical presentation may be difficult. It is considered that
      some patients with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome reported in the medical literature
      had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas. This is of crucial
      clinical relevance, because, by contrast with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome,
      treatment for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is already available.

TI  - Partial deletion of the gene encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase in a subject with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 662-72
AB  - An Italian subject with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was found to have a 
      partial deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27
      gene). Southern blot analysis revealed that this deletion (approximately 2 kb)
      spans from intron 6 to the 3' flanking (3'FLK) region, eliminating exons 7-9, the
      last three exons of CYP27 gene. No sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA was detected in
      proband cells, either by Northern blot analysis or by reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This suggests that the mutant mRNA devoid of the
      exon encoding the whole untranslated sequence (exon 9) might be rapidly degraded 
      in the cytoplasm. We used inverse PCR to obtain a partial sequence of the 3'FLK
      region of the normal CYP27 gene; this allowed us to define the mechanism
      underlying the deletion. The established sequence was used to design suitable
      primers to perform step-wise sequences of a 1.7 kb segment of the 3'FLK region of
      the normal gene and of the deletion joint in the CTX patient. The analysis of the
      sequence data indicate that the deletion might result from a complex mechanism
      involving two intragenic recombinations between a) two 14 nucleotide
      complementary sequences, one in intron 6 and the other in the 3'FLK region: and
      b) AT-rich complementary sequences of the 3'FLK region, and a slipped mispairing 
      between two 6 nucleotide direct repeats, one in intron 6 and the other in the
      3'FLK region. Such repeats are brought close to each other by the formation of
      the stem-loops induced by the two intragenic recombinations. This is the first
      example of CTX caused by a rearrangement of CYP27 gene.

TI  - A novel mutation in the cytochrome P450(27) (CYP27) gene caused cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis in a Japanese family.
PG  - 631-9
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage
      disease caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450(27) (CYP27) gene. This disease
      is characterized by the accumulation of a bile alcohol, cholestanol, in diverse
      tissues. Accumulation in the central nervous system leads to neurological
      dysfunction including dementia, spinal cord paresis, and cerebellar ataxia.
      Accumulation in other tissues causes tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis,
      and cataracts. In a Japanese family with CTX, we identified two points mutations 
      in the CYP27 gene at different sites. One is a novel transversion, which
      substitutes G for C at Pro 368 (CCC) to Arg (CGC). The other is a transition,
      which substitutes A for G at Arg441 (CGG) to Gln (CAG), this being the same
      mutation that Kim et al. reported (1994. J. Lipid Res. 35: 1031 - 1039).
      Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the father and 
      mother of this family, who themselves had no clinical manifestations of CTX, had 
      the former and latter mutations heterozygously, respectively. On the other hand, 
      the patients each had both mutations heterozygously. These results are highly
      suggestive, but not conclusive, that the newly identified transversion in the
      CYP27 gene accounts for the sterol 27-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.15) deficiency in
      these patients.

PG  - 110-3
AB  - We describe a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) who saw a
      Rheumatologist because of joint and muscle pain in the lower limbs. Clinical
      examination did not reveal any classic joint disease; however, tendon lesions and
      clumsy gait were noted. The patient presented with a swollen Achilles tendon
      bilaterally and a parapareto-spastic gait; Babinski sign was positive on the
      right side, and hyperreflexia of both lower limbs could be demonstrated. As
      bilateral cataracts were present, we have interpreted the aforementioned signs as
      CTX with spinal involvement; mean plasma cholesterol was increased, thus
      confirming the diagnosis. The primary biochemical abnormality of this disease is 
      a defect in the synthesis of bile acids; therefore, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 
      has been tried, and beneficial effects following CDCA treatment, especially in
      the early stages of CTX, have been reported in the literature. We report this
      case because of the severity and the rarity of this disease, and also because of 
      its hereditary transmission. Our aim is to underline the need of a precocious
      diagnosis, in order to prevent a further progression of the disease; this
      therapeutic goal can now be achieved, thanks to the therapeutic regimens recently
      developed.

TI  - Japanese triplets with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are homozygous for a mutant
      gene coding for the sterol 27-hydroxylase (Arg441Trp).
PG  - 571-4
AB  - We present the first case of triplets with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). 
      A C-to-T base change identified in the genomic DNA and cDNA encoding the sterol
      27-hydroxylase led to replacement of arginine by tryptophan at position 441
      (Arg441Trp) in the triplets. The triplets were homozygous and their mother was
      heterozygous for this mutant gene. The triplets exhibited an identical phenotypic
      expression, which was different from that of a sporadic CTX case with the same
      mutation.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a family study of sterol 27-hydroxylase mutations
      and pharmacotherapy.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - We examined the phenotypic characteristics, molecular genetics and optimal
      pharmacological treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in an English
      family with combined hyperlipidaemia. The proband presented in adulthood with
      classical clinical characteristics of CTX, a greater than tenfold elevation in
      plasma cholestanol and combined hyperlipidaemia. His brother also had typical
      features of CTX without the presence of dyslipidaemia. Genotyping revealed that
      the two brothers were compound heterozygotes for a novel missense mutation in
      exon 2 (R94Q) and for a recently described nonsense mutation in exon 5, of the
      sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). Analysis of all available family members
      revealed that hyperlipidaemia did not co-segregate with the presence of a CYP27
      mutant allele. Trial of therapy showed that the lowest plasma sterol and
      triglyceride concentrations and cholestanol:cholesterol ratio were achieved with 
      the combination of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 750 mg/day, a primary bile acid, 
      and simvastatin 40 mg/day, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A
      reductase. CDCA alone and simvastatin alone significantly lowered plasma
      cholestanol concentration, but the decrease was greater with the former. After 1 
      year there was significant improvement in both cognitive and motor function with 
      regression of tendon xanthomata on computerized tomography. We conclude that CTX 
      in this English pedigree is probably due to compound mutant alleles in CYP27,
      that combined hyperlipidaemia in this family is unrelated to CTX, and that this
      complicated condition responds optimally to the combination of CDCA and
      simvastatin.

TI  - Cholesterol and cataracts.
PG  - 320-37
AB  - Inherited defects in enzymes of cholesterol metabolism and use of drugs which
      inhibit lens cholesterol biosynthesis can be associated with cataracts in animals
      and man. The basis of this relationship apparently lies in the need of the lens
      to satisfy its sustained requirement for cholesterol by on-site synthesis, and
      impairing this synthesis can lead to alteration of lens membrane structure. Lens 
      membrane contains the highest cholesterol content of any known membrane. The
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, mevalonic aciduria, and cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis all involve mutations in enzymes of cholesterol metabolism, and
      affected patients can develop cataracts. Two established models of rodent
      cataracts are based on treatment with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. The
      long-term ocular safety of the very widely used vastatin class of
      hypocholesterolemic drugs is controversial. Some vastatins are potent inhibitors 
      of cholesterol biosynthesis by animal lenses, can block cholesterol accumulation 
      by these lenses and can produce cataracts in dogs. Whether these drugs inhibit
      cholesterol biosynthesis in human lenses at therapeutic doses is unknown. Results
      of clinical trials of 1-5 years duration in older patient populations indicate
      high ocular safety. However, considering the slow life-long growth of the lens
      and its continuing need for cholesterol, longterm safety of the vastatins should 
      perhaps be viewed in units of 10 or 20 years, particularly with younger patients.

TI  - Ocular and systemic manifestations of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - PURPOSE: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a storage disease that usually leads
      to severe mental and neurologic deterioration before the diagnosis and start of
      treatment are established. We identified major ocular and systemic
      characteristics that may enable a diagnosis to be made earlier. METHODS: Ten
      patients (group 1) of the University Hospital Nijmegen, with a diagnosis of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, were re-examined for detailed ocular and major
      clinical manifestations. Meanwhile, we looked for similar but undiagnosed cases
      in patients (group 2) who visited the Institute of Ophthalmology during a
      12-month period. RESULTS: A diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis had been 
      made in the patients of group 1 at an average age of 40 years (range, 33 to 48
      years). Subsequently, six new cases (group 2) were diagnosed in patients 7 to 37 
      years old (average age, 18 years). Bilateral cataract was the major ocular
      manifestation in all 16 patients. Small irregular corticonuclear opacities,
      anterior polar cataracts, and dense posterior subcapsular cataracts were
      diagnosed at various ages (mean, 18 years; range, 4 to 40 years). Four patients
      showed clinical signs of optic neuropathy, whereas retinal function was normal in
      all patients. Other major clinical signs included a history of chronic diarrhea
      (since childhood), mental deterioration (mean age, 23 years), neurologic
      deterioration (mean age, 31 years), and tendon xanthomas (mean age, 37 years).
      CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate biochemical investigations for cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis should be performed in patients with unexplained juvenile or
      early-onset adult cataracts, especially if these cataracts are associated with
      chronic diarrhea since infancy, mental retardation or deterioration, neurologic
      dysfunction, or xanthomas.

      beta-cholestane-23-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid from urine of a patient
      with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, respectively. Hence, the
      glucurono-conjugated positions of the biliary 25-tetrol glucuronide and the
      biliary 23,25-pentol glucuronide were C-3 and C-23, respectively. By comparison
      of the 13C chemical shift data with that of the unconjugated bile alcohol, 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23-tetrol, the glucurono-conjugated
      position of the natural 23-tetrol glucuronide was determined to be C-23. Thus,
      the natural 23-tetrol glucuronide can be formulated as 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12
      alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-23-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid.

PG  - 1069-72
AB  - In a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a rare familial sterol storage 
      disease, increased uptake of gallium-67 was observed in the tendon xanthomas.
      This is considered to have resulted from the tumour-like proliferation of
      histiocytic cells in the xanthomas. Abnormalities in the white matter of the
      cerebellum and the brain stem observed by X-ray computed tomography and magnetic 
      resonance imaging were not detected by 67Ga scintigraphy, possibly due to the
      small size of the CNS lesions.

TI  - [A case of complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia associated with
      hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cataracta].
PG  - 798-802
AB  - Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive varieties of
      spastic paraplegia have been recognized. Recently, Japanese patients with
      complicated form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)
      associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum have been reported by Iwabuchi 
      et al. We describe a patient with complicated HSP (Iwabuchi type) and cataracta. 
      A 38-year-old man (his parents were a second cousin) was born uneventfully. His
      motor development was normal. Motor and mental dysfunctions were noticed during
      the lower classes of an elementary school. He could ride a bicycle at 18 years
      old but gradually developed galt disturbance and confined to wheelchair since 35 
      years. He was admitted to our hospital on February 25, 1994. A neurological
      examination showed mental retardation, dementia, cataracta, cerebellar ataxia,
      rigidity, spasticity, severe atrophy of the distal muscles of his extremities,
      paraparesis, hyperreflexia, positive Hoffmann reflexes and Babinski signs, pes
      cavus and hammer toes. Brain MRI showed thinning of corpus callosum. Clinical and
      laboratory findings did not support a diagnosis of metabolic disorders showing
      spastic paraparesis including adrenomyeloneuropathy, Globoid leukodystrophy,
      metachromatic leukodystrophy, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Arginase
      deficiency. We considered that our patient was complicated form of HSP (Iwabuchi 
      et al). However, cataract has not been found in Iwabuchi type of HSP. We
      discussed here other reports showing cataracta with spastic paraparesis.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis diagnosed after traumatic subdural haematoma.
PG  - 675-8
AB  - We report the case of a 34-year old man, who, after presenting with subacute
      traumatic subdural haematoma, was diagnosed as CTX. He presented a ten year
      history of progressive deterioration of cognitive functions, unsteadiness of gait
      and surgery for bilateral cataracts at age 21. Cholestanol level in serum was
      120.7 mmol/liter, and cholestanol/cholesterol ratio 2.52%. Bile alcohols in urine
      were 23, 25-pentol: 2.2665 mg/mmol creatinine, 24, 25-pentol: 1.3226 mg/mmol
      creatinine, and 27-nor-24, 25-pentol: 0.7363 mg/mmol creatinine.
      Electrophysiological study was consistent with a mixed demyelinating and axonal
      neuropathy. The assessment of autonomic nervous system (ANS) showed a
      postganglionic cholinergic failure accompanying somatic peripheral neuropathy.
      Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) demonstrated markedly low amplitude
      and poorly defined waves, and almost symmetrical peak V and I to V interpeak
      latency (IPL) slight delays. Two nodular, bilateral, symmetrical lesions,
      strongly suggestive of calcifications, in the cerebellar white matter on CT and
      MRI were noted. On T2-weighted images diffuse high signal lesions were found in
      the cerebellar white matter, and multiple, hyperintense cerebral foci of
      demyelination or gliosis. MRI study of the Achilles tendon showed neither
      enlargement of the tendon, nor areas of lipid deposits. After ten months of
      treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (750 mg/d) the clinical course was
      unaffected and the neurophysiological measures, CT and MRI remained unchanged.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid-storage
      disease caused by mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). So far
      several mutations causing CTX have been identified and characterized. A new
      mutation creating an insertion of cytosine at position 6 in the cDNA, which is
      expected to result in a frameshift and a premature termination codon at codon
      179, has been identified in a French family. The mutation creates a new site for 
      the restriction endonuclease HaeIII.

TI  - The neuropathology of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis revisited: a case report and
      review of the literature.
PG  - 213-20
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare autosomal-recessive lipid storage
      disease, has been well characterized clinically and biochemically, and recently
      also from the molecular biological aspect. However, only a very few publications 
      deal with its neuropathology, and views on its pathogenesis vary. Based on a
      recently examined case, we propose that central-peripheral distal axonopathy is
      the major pathogenetic mechanism of nervous system injury in CTX. The latter is
      characterized by white matter pathology, typically in form of long tract
      involvement with the more distal parts of the tract more severely affected. Most 
      severely affected are the cerebellar white matter, the optic pathways and the
      long tracts of the brain stem and spinal cord, particularly the pyramidal tracts,
      although there is hardly a CNS region which does not display some form of
      pathology. Lesions are characterized by loss of myelinated fibers and
      accumulation of lipid products in form of foamy macrophages, clear
      oil-red-O-positive spaces and crystalline clefts, accompanied by gliosis,
      occasional axonal spheroids, and in the cerebellum--the most severely affected
      structure--also by multi-nucleated foreign body giant cells. Demyelination is not
      seen, and ultrastructurally myelin sheaths are normally structured. Signs of
      axonal degeneration are also present in the spinal roots. We hypothesize that the
      basic enzymatic defect in CTX leads to accumulation of metabolites in the brain
      which may be neurotoxic and may impair the metabolic apparatus of neurons with
      resultant axonopathy and subsequent nonspecific lipid deposition in the injured
      tracts.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in the Israeli Druze: molecular genetics and
      phenotypic characteristics.
PG  - 907-15
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid-storage
      disease caused by mutations in the sterol 27 hydroxylase gene (CYP27).
      Clinically, a multitude of neurological, skeletal, and vascular manifestations
      are usually present. Premature atherosclerosis has been reported in CTX and may
      be related to the metabolic derangement caused by the deficiency of the enzyme. A
      CYP27 nonsense mutation created by the deletion of cytosine376 has been
      identified in four Israeli Druze CTX patients residing in the same village.
      Molecular screening for this mutation in families of two probands revealed a
      total of 10 homozygotes and 28 heterozygotes whose clinical and biochemical
      characteristics are described. Overall, except for tendon xanthomas, most of the 
      clinical manifestations progress with age. The CYP27 mutation was associated with
      modest differences in the levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL
      cholesterol (LDL-C). The distribution of plasma concentrations of TC and LDL-C in
      the CTX families was consistent with a polygenic model. A similar model that
      includes also the effects of the CYP27 genotypes was not better supported by the 
      data. It may be concluded that, in CTX, the presence of a CYP27 mutation does not
      significantly affect the plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins.
      Therefore, the reported increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in this disease
      must be related to other factors.

TI  - Bile acid synthesis in HepG2 cells: effect of cyclosporin.
PG  - 1795-800
AB  - The hypothesis that cyclosporin specifically affects the pathway of bile acid
      synthesis that begins with 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol was evaluated in HepG2
      cells, which synthesize chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid from endogenous 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol. At a concentration in the medium of 8.3 microM
      cyclosporin, the proportion of cholic acid increased from 29 +/- 7% to 44 +/- 6% 
      (P < 0.001) with no major change in total bile acid production. Chenodeoxycholic 
      acid synthesis was enhanced by the addition of either 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol 
      or 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha-diol to the medium and cholic acid synthesis
      was enhanced by the addition of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol 
      to the medium. Cyclosporin significantly inhibited only enhanced chenodeoxycholic
      acid synthesis, indicating a selective interference in mitochondrial side chain
      oxidation of less polar intermediates in bile acid synthesis derived from either 
      initial 7 alpha- or initial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol. The increase in the 
      proportion of cholic acid that occurs in the presence of cyclosporin mimics that 
      occurring in genetically determined sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency
      (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis). Cyclosporin is useful for dissecting the
      subcellular pathways of bile acid synthesis.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein disease): CT and MR
      findings.
PG  - 1721-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the CT and MR findings in the brain and spinal cord of
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and to seek possible correlations
      between clinical, biochemical (cholestanol levels), and neuroimaging findings.
      METHODS: Ten patients with well-defined clinical and biochemical diagnoses of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis were examined. Brain CT was performed in eight
      cases. In all patients MR was obtained using spin-echo and gradient-echo
      sequences. In eight patients spine MR was also performed. RESULTS:
      Neuroradiologic findings included diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. In
      half the cases, atrophy of the brain stem and corpus callosum was also found. In 
      the majority of patients cerebellar bilateral focal lesions and mild white matter
      signal alterations were present. Spinal cord MR did not show signal abnormalities
      or atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: We found cranial alterations in patients with severe
      neurologic impairment, but there was no correlation with cholestanol plasma
      levels. No spinal cord abnormalities were present.

TI  - Atherosclerosis and sterol 27-hydroxylase: evidence for a role of this enzyme in 
      elimination of cholesterol from human macrophages.
PG  - 8592-6
AB  - 27-Hydroxycholesterol was found in surprisingly high amounts in atherosclerotic
      human femoral arteries. When human macrophages were cultured in a medium
      containing serum, there was a significant transfer of 27-hydroxy-cholesterol and 
      3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid from the cells into the medium. Sterol
      27-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.15) is likely to be responsible for formation of the
      two products as shown by use of immunoblotting, a specific inhibitor, and the
      18O-labeling technique. Sterol 27-hydroxylase has the unusual ability to
      hydroxylate the same methyl group three times to give a carboxylic acid; thus, 3 
      beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid is likely to be a direct product of the enzyme. 
      The production of these steroids increased after addition of cholesterol to the
      culture medium. By using deuterium-labeled cholesterol, it was ascertained that
      most of the oxidized products were formed from exogenous cholesterol taken up by 
      the cells. 27-Hydroxycholesterol and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid are
      present in the circulation and are efficiently converted into bile acids in human
      liver. It is suggested that conversion of cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol 
      and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid represents a general defence mechanism for
      macrophages and possibly also other peripheral cells exposed to cholesterol.
      Absence of this defence mechanism may contribute to the premature atherosclerosis
      known to occur in patients with sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency
      (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis).

TI  - Comparative effects of lovastatin and chenodeoxycholic acid on plasma cholestanol
      levels and abnormal bile acid metabolism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1018-22
AB  - We investigated the effect of the hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A
      (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin and the primary bile acid
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on plasma sterol and bile alcohol concentrations and
      the excretion of bile alcohols in urine in a 38-year-old homozygote with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Untreated, plasma cholesterol
      concentrations were less than normal (171 +/- 5 v 185 +/- 3 mg/dL, P < .05) while
      plasma cholestanol levels were more than 20 times higher than the control mean
      (2.26 +/- 0.17 v 0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dL, P < .0001). Plasma and urinary bile alcohol
      concentrations were markedly increased (12.6 +/- 0.6 and 154 micrograms/mL,
      respectively, v trace amounts in controls), with the ratio of 5 beta-cholestane-3
      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha, 25-tetrol to 5 beta-cholestane, 3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,23 (22 and 24),25-pentols being 1.6 in plasma and reversed to 0.15 in
      urine. Treatment with lovastatin (40 mg/d) reduced plasma cholesterol
      concentrations 13%, but failed to decrease plasma cholestanol or bile alcohol
      levels. Abundant amounts of bile alcohols continued to be excreted in urine. In
      contrast, CDCA (750 mg/d) inhibited abnormal bile acid synthesis, as evidence by 
      a 17-fold decrease in total bile alcohol levels in plasma and a 29-fold decrease 
      in urine and the virtual elimination of cholic acid and deoxycholic acid from the
      bile. Plasma cholestanol concentrations also decreased 85%, but cholesterol
      levels increased 14%. The combination of CDCA with lovastatin did not improve
      plasma cholestanol or bile alcohol concentrations compared with CDCA treatment
      alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 22-8
AB  - Treatments by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone,
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, and
      combination of the two drugs were attempted for 7 patients with cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis (CTX). CDCA treatment at a dose of 300 mg/day reduced serum
      cholestanol (67.3% reduction), lathosterol (50.8%), campesterol (61.7%) and
      sitosterol (12.7%). However, the sera of the patients changed to be
      "atherogenic"; total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL)-cholesterol were increased, while high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL)-cholesterol was decreased. Contrarily, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day
      improved the sera of the patients to be markedly "anti-atherogenic", but the
      reductions of cholestanol (30.4%), lathosterol (44.0%), campesterol (22.9%) and
      sitosterol (9.6%) were inadequate. Combined treatment with CDCA and pravastatin
      showed good overlapping of the effects of each drug alone. The sera of the
      patients were apparently more "anti-atherogenic" than those after CDCA treatment.
      Serum cholestanol concentration was still 2.7 times higher than in controls, but 
      the serum lathosterol level was within the normal range, indicating that the
      enhancement of overall cholesterol synthesis in the patients was sufficiently
      suppressed. Plant sterol levels were also within the normal range. The
      combination of CDCA and pravastatin was a good treatment for CTX, based on the
      improvement of serum lipoprotein metabolism, the suppression of cholesterol
      synthesis, and reductions of cholestanol and plant sterol levels. In all of 7
      patients, the progression of disease was arrested, but dramatic effects on
      clinical manifestations, xanthoma, and electrophysiological findings could not be
      found after the treatment of these drugs.

TI  - Identification of new mutations in sterol 27-hydroxylase gene in Japanese
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
PG  - 1031-9
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a hereditary sterol storage disease
      associated with accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in various tissues,
      especially tendons and neural tissues. The biochemical defect that causes CTX is 
      a deficiency of the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase which oxidizes the side
      chain of cholesterol in connection with formation of bile acids. Japan has a
      relatively high prevalence of CTX and more cases of the disease are found here
      than in any other country. In the present study two new different point mutations
      are described in the heme-ligand binding domain of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene
      in three Japanese CTX patients and one CTX heterozygote. Two of the homozygotes
      as well as the heterozygote subject have a single base substitution of A for G at
      codon 441 [CGG (Arg) to CAG (Gln)]. Another homozygote has a transition of C to T
      at codon 441 [CGG (Arg) to TGG (Trp)]. These two different mutations result in
      two restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for the enzymes StuI or
      HpaII. We also assayed sterol 27-hydroxylase activity using skin fibroblasts
      derived from three CTX patients, one CTX heterozygote, and normal subjects. While
      two of the homozygous subjects have undetectable levels of the enzyme activity,
      one homozygous subject and one heterozygous subject have decreased levels of the 
      enzyme activity, about 1.4% and 10% of normal, respectively. The results suggest 
      that the newly identified point mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene could
      account for the sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency in the Japanese CTX patients.

      excreted in urine of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis by a nuclear

PG  - 655-8
AB  - This paper describes the determination of the glucurono-conjugated position in
      two bile alcohol glucuronides excreted in urine of a patient with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis by a nuclear magnetic resonance study. The urine
      sample was extracted with reversed-phase resin, and chromatographed on a
      reversed-phase partition column and a silica gel column to isolate
      glucurono-conjugates of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol
      and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23,25- pentol. Proton and
      carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the natural tetrol glucuronide
      were identical with those of the chemically synthesized tetrol glucuronide, 7
      alpha, 12 alpha, 25-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha-O-beta-D-
      glucopyranosyluronic acid. Hence, the glucurono-conjugated position of the
      natural tetrol glucuronide was determined to be the C-3 position. By comparison
      of the 13C chemical shift data with that of the unconjugated pentol, 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 23,25-pentol, the glucurono-conjugated position
      of the natural pentol glucuronide was determined to be C-23. Thus the natural
      pentol glucuronide can be formulated as 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-
      tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-23-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid. The
      difference in the glucurono-conjugated position between the 25-tetrol glucuronide
      and the 23,25-pentol glucuronide indicates that the former is not the
      biosynthetic precursor of the latter.

PG  - 663-8
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familial disorder characterized by
      progressive neurological dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and xanthomas with sterol 
      storage in the nervous system, vessels, and tendons. Increased serum cholestanol,
      derived from intermediates of cholesterol catabolism, may possibly be a major
      cause of the disease. An examination was made of the cDNA encoding cytochrome
      P450 sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) in hepatic mitochondria, considered a
      defective enzyme inducing CTX, in a Japanese housewife afflicted with CTX and her
      family. The proposita and one of her brothers, who also had CTX symptoms and
      hypercholestanolemia, were found to be homozygotic, carrying a point mutation in 
      the CYP27 gene at Arg104 (CGG) to Trp104 (TGG). The mutant position has a 100%
      conserved positive charge in all known vertebrate cytochrome P450s and even in
      bacterial cytochrome P450cam. The mother of the proposita and another brother
      were both free of CTX symptoms and were heterozygotic for the mutation, although 
      their plasma cholesterol increased moderately. An increase in plasma cholestanol 
      alone would, thus, not appear to be a direct cause of sterol storage in CTX,
      while CTX is strongly suggested to be caused by defects in both alleles of the
      CYP27 gene.

      (13/13) and cerebellar (12/13) atrophy and diffuse white matter hypodensity
      (4/13) presumably reflecting sterol infiltration with demyelination. Focal
      lesions were rare (2/13). Mass effect, edema or enhancement were not observed.
      Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 750 mg/day orally improved
      neurological and biochemical abnormalities. MRI appears to be of little value in 
      following improvement after treatment has begun. Otherwise, the MRI studies are
      very sensitive and useful in diagnosing early incomplete forms of CTX.

      involvement, juvenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and premature atherosclerosis

      mutations were shown to cause CTX in four Jewish families of Moroccan origin. An 
      additional mutant allele, found in a Jewish family of Algerian origin is
      characterized here. Sequence analysis revealed a C to T transition at cDNA
      position 1037 which predicted a threonine to methionine substitution at residue
      306 (designated T306M). It is highly suggestive, but not definitive, that this
      transition is the mutation causing CTX in this family. A search for additional
      cases from Jewish families of North African extraction identified five new
      families including 10 cases. The three sterol 27-hydroxylase gene mutations
      account for all 10 CTX families and their presence may suggest the existence of
      positive selective forces that lead to an increased prevalence of this relatively
      rare disease in Jews from North Africa.

PG  - 361-72
AB  - The isolation, purification, and cloning of the mitochondrial P450 enzyme
      catalyzing not only the 27-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7
      alpha-diol and cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol, but also the
      25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 are reviewed. The sterol hydroxylase was shown to 
      be present on the mitochondrial inner membrane-matrix, to be inactivated by
      carbon monoxide, and to be activated by 450 nm radiation, establishing its
      membership in the P450 class. Characterization of the reaction product indicated 
      that hydroxylation occurred on the 27 methyl group; the enzyme also mediated
      25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3. Cloning of the enzyme confirmed that it was of
      mitochondrial origin and that it catalyzed both sterol and vitamin D
      hydroxylation. Enzymatic activity was deficient in fibroblasts from patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Genetic analysis of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis has shown several genetic defects: 1) two
      different point mutations in which arginine codons were replaced by cysteine
      codons; 2) deletion of thymidine in exon 4; and 3) a guanosine to adenosine
      substitution at the 3' splice acceptor site of intron 4 of the gene. The
      mitochondrial 27-hydroxylase is a key enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis and can be
      distinguished from microsomal hydroxylases that also catalyze hydroxylation of
      the side chain of cholesterol and intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis. In the
      rat, a microsomal enzyme catalyzes 26-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,
      7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol, but the importance of this pathway in bile acid
      biosynthesis is unclear.

PG  - 256-9
AB  - We investigated the therapeutic effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day) in
      three siblings with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. All three siblings had
      characteristic clinical manifestations, abnormal findings of magnetic resonance
      imaging and electroencephalogram, and high serum levels of cholestanol,
      cholesterol precursor (lathosterol), and plant sterols (campesterol, sitosterol).
      After treatment for one year, the serum levels of these sterols were decreased
      and some neurologic improvements in the pyramidal tract signs and cerebellar
      signs were noted. The electroencephalographic findings were markedly changed and 
      normalized. However, mental defects and sensorimotor polyneuropathy still
      remained. No changes of neuroradiologic features could be detected. A longer
      period of treatment is required to estimate the overall effects of
      chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

PG  - 288-90
AB  - We report an early molecular diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in
      a Jewish Moroccan family with two affected siblings. The proband displayed
      characteristic manifestations of the disease, whereas a younger brother,
      homozygous for the mutant allele, was asymptomatic. Clinical studies in the
      younger patient disclosed mild cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and
      abnormal EEG. Elevated plasma cholestanol levels were evident in both affected
      patients, with documented normal levels in the molecularly diagnosed heterozygous
      family members. Molecular characterization of affected CTX families provides
      early diagnosis and treatment of homozygotes in the presymptomatic state as well 
      as identification of heterozygotes, which is crucial for genetic counseling and
      for prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - Chenodeoxycholate: the bile acid. The drug. a review.
PG  - 54-63
AB  - Chenodeoxycholate (3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanic acid) is a primary 
      bile acid directly synthesized from cholesterol. It is an amphipathic molecule,
      possessing both a hydrophobic side and a polar hydrophilic side, giving it the
      ability to solubilize lipids in a water environment. Bile acids are necessary for
      the absorption of fats and fat soluble vitamins. Chenodeoxycholate inhibits the
      rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, the formation of
      hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A. It was first reported to be useful in the
      dissolution of cholesterol gallstones in 1972. Today, chenodeoxycholate has other
      medicinal uses and is used for the management of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, 
      hypertriglyceremia, congenital liver diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and
      constipation. This article details some finer points of chenodeoxycholate
      biochemistry and physiology and discusses in some detail the current and past
      clinical uses of chenodeoxycholate. This is not an exhaustive discussion on
      gallstone dissolution therapies, but an overview of some of the lesser-known uses
      for this drug.

      described: 7-dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase deficiency, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid
      delta 5-oxidoreductase/isomerase deficiency, 3-oxo-delta 4-steroid 5
      beta-reductase deficiency, sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis), and peroxisomal disease(s) with absence of peroxisomes. Diagnosis
      and treatment of these very rare disorders are discussed. Bile acid therapy is
      important in most of these disorders and in the case of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid
      delta 5-oxidoreductase/isomerase deficiency and 3-oxo-delta 4-steroid 5
      beta-reductase deficiency such therapy may save the life of the affected
      cholestatic infant. In the case of sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency, early
      treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid may prevent the development of progressive
      neurological dysfunction, dementia, and ataxia. In the latter three cases early
      diagnosis and treatment is of utmost importance.

      with dementia, tendinous xanthomas, cataracts, pyramidal involvement, cerebellar 
      ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. Cerebral CT scan demonstrated diffuse
      hypodensity in the white matter in both cerebellar hemispheres while MR detected 
      additional focal alterations in both frontal lobes. MR study of the Achilles
      tendon showed a diffuse enlargement of the tendon with multiple areas of
      hypersignals in T1 and T2 demonstrative of the lipid deposits, interpossed
      between the isosignal zones that may correspond to the inflammatory reaction
      secondary to the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol.

TI  - [Inborn errors of bile acid metabolism].
PG  - 125-34
AB  - A review on inherited diseases caused by defects in the synthesis of bile acids
      is presented. In the first part the biochemical synthesis of bile acids from
      cholesterol, taking place in the liver, is described. Three consecutive events
      can be discerned: 1. modifications in the skeleton of cholesterol, 2. oxidation
      of the last carbon atom of the cholesterol side chain, 3. further oxidation of
      the side chain leading to shortening with three carbon atoms; this last step
      takes place in liver peroxisomes. In the second part a description of inborn
      errors (enzyme deficiencies) is given, which can occur in each of the above
      mentioned three steps, leading to serious aberrations. As a result abnormal
      metabolites, i.e. bile acids or sterols, are present in serum or urine, which can
      be detected using advanced analytical techniques like gas chromatography or mass 
      spectrometry, leading to diagnosis. In contrast to defects in the first or third 
      step in bile acid synthesis, giving rise to disorders already shortly after
      birth, symptoms of the disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, caused by a defect
      in the second step, are only noticeable several years after birth. A number of
      these diseases can be treated successfully, but for peroxisomal defects no useful
      therapy exists.

TI  - Frameshift and splice-junction mutations in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene cause 
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in Jews or Moroccan origin.
PG  - 2488-96
AB  - The sterol 27-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.15) catalyzes steps in the oxidation of
      sterol intermediates that form bile acids. Mutations in this gene give rise to
      the autosomal recessive disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is
      characterized by tendon xanthomas, cataracts, a multitude of neurological
      manifestations, and premature atherosclerosis. A relatively high prevalence of
      the disease has been noted in Jews originating from Morocco. The major objectives
      of the present investigation were to determine the gene structure and
      characterize the common mutant alleles that cause CTX in Moroccan Jews. The gene 
      contains nine exons and eight introns and encompasses at least 18.6 kb of DNA.
      The putative promoter region is rich in guanidine and cytosine residues and
      contains potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and the liver
      transcription factor, LF-B1. Blotting analysis revealed that the mutant alleles
      do not produce any detectable sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA. No major gene
      rearrangements were found and single-strand conformational polymorphism followed 
      by sequence analysis identified two underlying mutations: deletion of thymidine
      in exon 4 and a guanosine to adenosine substitution at the 3' splice acceptor
      site of intron 4 of the gene. The molecular characterization of CTX in Jews of
      Moroccan origin provides a definitive diagnosis of this treatable disease.

TI  - [Congenital deficiencies in bile acid synthesis: from diagnosis to treatment].
PG  - 110-5
AB  - Bile acids represent the principal excretion pathway of cholesterol. Their
      synthesis involves hydroxylations of the sterol nucleus and shortening of the
      lateral chain transforming an highly insoluble and immiscible molecule in an
      hydrophilic and detergent one. Congenital defect of one of the enzymes of bile
      acid synthesis (26-alpha-hydroxylase) constitutes the etiology of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, associating degenerative disease of the central
      nervous system, cutaneous xanthomas and cataract; the degenerative process may be
      stopped by a substitutive therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid. In another syndrome
      characterised by a lack of peroxisomes (Zellweger disease and associated
      syndromes), some bile acid metabolites accumulate due to the enzymatic block.
      Some cases of malabsorption due to a congenital defect of bile sterol synthesis
      are reported; such a case was jointly investigated in Brussels and Groningen.

      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide and its corresponding
      C-26 analogue is described. The method involves direct coupling of bile alcohols,
      namely, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol and 24-nor-5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol to methyl
      (tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranuronate) in the presence of a Lewis acid,
      tin(IV) chloride, in dichloromethane. The resulting anomeric pairs of 1,2-trans- 
      and 1,2-cis-glucuronides of tetrols were resolved by analytical and preparative
      thin-layer chromatography, and their identities were established by
      high-resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy and by chemical-ionization and
      fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry. The method described has a practical
      advantage over the traditional two-step synthesis involving bromides as it is
      more efficient and uses inexpensive and less toxic materials. It is suggested
      that these compounds will be useful for studying permeability of the blood-brain 
      barrier in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).

      abnormalities of 5 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Levels of 
      both cholestanol and cholesterol decreased to approximately 60% of those of
      pretreatment after one perfusion and gradually returned to their initial levels
      within 2 weeks. Improvement of clinical manifestations and regression of Achilles
      tendon xanthomas were detected after several perfusions, though dramatic changes 
      could not be recognized. EEG abnormalities were improved immediately after
      LDL-apheresis in one patient. We conclude that LDL-apheresis may affect the serum
      cholestanol level and clinical manifestations in patients with CTX.

AB  - Significant osteoporosis determined by skeleton radiography and bone densitometry
      was found in 15 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) whose mean age
      was 31 +/- 11 years. In three CTX patients, bone biopsies confirmed osteoporosis.
      Nine patients also sustained bone fractures following minimal trauma. Serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D ([25-OHD] 14.6 +/- 6.6 ng/mL v [normal] 30.4 +/- 8.0 ng/mL; P
      < .001) and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ([24,25(OH)2D] 1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/mL v [normal] 
      2.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mL; P < .001) levels were low. Serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D,
      calcium, inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and
      calcitonin were normal. Patients showed classic manifestations of CTX, including 
      dementia, pyramidal and cerebellar insufficiency, peripheral neuropathy,
      cataracts, and tendon xanthomas associated with elevated serum cholestanol
      concentrations. These results demonstrate that extensive osteoporosis and
      increased risk of bone fractures are components of this inherited disease.

PG  - 1190-4
AB  - We present and discuss the clinical and biochemical findings of three siblings
      with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, which has not been previously reported in
      Taiwan. Clinical features consisted of tendinous xanthomas, cataracts, mental
      defects, pyramidal signs, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and renal
      stones. Biochemical findings included normal serum cholesterol levels, high serum
      cholestanol levels and elevated serum cholestanol to cholesterol ratios. The
      serum levels of cholesterol precursor (lathosterol) and plant sterols
      (campesterol, sitosterol) were also elevated.

TI  - Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials in the assessment of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis before and after treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid: a
      preliminary study.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - We studied two unrelated patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, in whom
      clinical examination revealed central nervous system long tract involvement.
      Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs supporting the
      involvement of the long pathways. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials
      demonstrated central sensory and motor conduction abnormalities, which suggested 
      distal degeneration of longer fibers, rather than scattered focal lesions in the 
      CNS. In one of the patients the neurophysiological study was repeated 6 and 12
      months after the beginning of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, showing a
      progressive improvement. Therefore, our data suggest that central motor and
      sensory conduction studies may be useful in the assessment of the disease and in 
      monitoring treatment.

TI  - [Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis--a case of brain MRI abnormality and
      osteoporosis].
PG  - 488-93
AB  - A 37-year-old male with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis showed brain abnormal MRI 
      findings and osteoporosis. His parents had no similar symptoms. He had mental
      retardation since childhood. Swelling of Achilles tendons was noticed at age 28, 
      and gait disturbance appeared at age 34. Physical examination revealed bilateral 
      cataracts and swelling of Achilles tendons. Neurologically, he showed mental
      retardation, cerebellar ataxia and spastic tetraparesis. Cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis was diagnosed by marked elevations of serum cholestanol level (24.3
      micrograms/ml) and cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (1.81%) as well as
      characteristic clinical manifestations. On brain MRI study, T2-weighted sequence 
      showed bilateral focal lesions with high intensity signal in the globus pallidus 
      and cerebellar white matter adjacent to the dentate nucleus, and T1-weighted
      sequence showed low to iso-intensity signal in the same regions. These findings
      suggested demyelination rather than xanthoma or lipid infiltration. Radiological 
      examination showed mild osteoporosis of lumbar bone. However, serum levels of
      vitamin D3 and calcitonin were within normal range, and renal function was
      normal. Osteoporosis in this patient possibly resulted from disuse bone atrophy
      for several years. The combination therapy of oral administration of
      chenodeoxycholic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin), and LDL
      apheresis slightly improved EEG abnormality and gait disturbance, but not brain
      MRI abnormality.

AB  - Evoked potentials are reported in 10 patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis, eight of whom had peripheral neuropathy. Four subjects showed
      delayed N13 to N20 interpeak latencies for arm somatosensory evoked potentials,
      and five showed moderately prolonged I to III and I to V interpeak latencies of
      brain-stem auditory evoked potentials. Six of seven patients showed marked delay 
      and desynchronization of visual evoked potentials. All five patients undergoing
      transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex presented greatly delayed
      central motor conduction time, especially of the lower limbs. After treatment
      with chenodiol (750 mg/d for at least 2 years), there was a significant
      improvement in nerve conduction velocities, N13 to N20 interpeak latencies, and
      visual evoked potential latencies. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials remained
      unchanged.

AB  - We report the findings on cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and their correlation with the clinical manifestations, disease
      severity and biochemical abnormalities in eight patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis. CT revealed cerebral atrophy in seven cases, cerebellar atrophy in
      four and focal low density lesions in the cerebral white matter in two.
      T2-weighted MRI showed high signal lesions in the cerebral white matter, focal in
      four cases and diffuse in one, and in the globus pallidus in three patients, two 
      of whom also had lesions in the cerebellar white matter. While severely affected 
      patients showed variable CT and MRI abnormalities, our cases did not show the
      dramatic findings expected from the neurological manifestations. Diffuse lesions 
      in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter have been emphasized in previous
      reports, but in our study the focal lesions in the cerebral white matter were
      also present; the globus pallidus was frequently involved.

PG  - 13-22
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familial lipid storage disease
      caused by defective bile acid synthesis. As a result, cholestanol, a derivative
      of cholesterol, is accumulated by virtually every tissue, predominantly by the
      nervous system, xanthomas and bile. Clinically, progressive neurologic
      dysfunction, tendon xanthomas, cataracts, osteoporosis and atherosclerosis are
      commonly found. Replacement therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day), a
      primary bile acid, which is almost absent from the bile in CTX, reduces elevated 
      cholestanol synthesis and concentrations and improves neurologic function in this
      disease.

PG  - S165-7
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a familial sterol storage disease based
      on an inborn error of metabolism involving bile acid synthesis. Predominant
      clinical features are a chronic progressive neurological syndrome, mental
      deterioration, bilateral cataract and xanthomas. The presence of xanthomas
      usually leads to the diagnosis, and the reverse is probably also true: without
      xanthomas the diagnosis will often not be made. CTX may therefore be less rare
      than commonly thought, and the incidence of xanthomas in CTX may be
      overestimated. Four cases without xanthomas among the presenting symptoms are
      described, and the relevance of xanthomas in CTX is discussed.

TI  - Electrophysiological studies in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 52-5
AB  - Seven patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were studied by
      electrophysiological techniques. The percentages of abnormalities detected in
      nerve conduction studies and electroencephalograms were 28.6% (two patients) and 
      100%, respectively. All patients showed prolonged central conduction times in
      short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) by tibial nerve stimulation
      but normal SSEPs by median nerve stimulation. Brain stem auditory evoked
      potentials and visual evoked potentials were abnormal in three (42.9%) and four
      patients (57.1%), respectively. These electrophysiological parameters were
      correlated with the ratio of serum cholestanol to cholesterol concentration. The 
      results of SSEPs suggest that the polyneuropathy in CTX is caused by distal
      axonopathy affecting longer axons before shorter axons (central-peripheral distal
      axonopathy).

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare hereditary disease characterized
      by xanthomata of tendons, osteoporosis, cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, spastic
      paresis, and dementia. Though electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities are
      frequent in CTX, epileptic seizures have not been recognized as a major feature. 
      A CTX patient is reported who presented with a generalized epileptic seizure and 
      was evaluated with EEG and neuropsychological testing. Epilepsy should be
      considered a feature of CTX, and CTX considered as a possible, though rare, cause
      of symptomatic seizures.

TI  - Atherogenic risk factors in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - In a study of coronary artery disease in patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX), we documented the presence or absence of atherogenic risk
      factors and performed detailed analyses of serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles. 
      Four of the seven patients examined had coronary arterial narrowing and/or
      obstruction, but multiple atherogenic risk factors were not found in any of these
      patients. Total cholesterol (T.ch) levels and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol
      (LDL-ch) levels were lower, and high density lipoprotein2-cholesterol (HDL2-ch)
      levels were higher in CTX patients than in controls. Triglyceride and very low
      density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly lower in the former. Indices
      correlating with the risk of atherosclerosis, such as the atherogenic index, and 
      the ratios of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein AI, HDL2-ch/LDL-ch,
      HDL2-ch/HDL3-ch, indicated that CTX serum was, in fact, 'anti-atherogenic'.
      However, coronary artery disease is frequently seen in patients with CTX. This
      discrepancy suggests the existence of a unique mechanism by which atherosclerosis
      is induced in patients with CTX. We discuss a mechanism of disturbed lipoprotein 
      metabolism which might be responsible for the deposition of sterols in the
      tissues of patients with CTX.

      cholestanol levels associated with marked regression of tendon xanthomas in
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 741-6
AB  - We studied the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and a competitive HMG-CoA
      reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, on clinical symptoms and sterol metabolism in a
      36-year-old Japanese man with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). He had marked
      tendon xanthomas and mild dementia, with obvious electroencephalographic (EEG)
      abnormalities. He was treated for 2 years with CDCA alone (0.6 g/d) and then for 
      a further year with the combination of pravastatin (10 mg/d) and CDCA (0.6 g/d). 
      For the following year, he was given pravastatin alone, and then was returned to 
      combined treatment again. The plasma cholestanol level before treatment was 3.12 
      mg/dL, which was 20 times above the control level. After CDCA alone, the plasma
      cholestanol was reduced to 1.96 mg/dL, and this was further reduced to 0.92 mg/dL
      by combination therapy with CDCA and pravastatin. However, after the
      discontinuation of CDCA, his cholestanol levels returned to the pretreatment
      levels despite the continuing of pravastatin treatment. When the combination
      therapy was restarted, his cholestanol level was once again markedly reduced. His
      clinical symptoms showed a close association with the plasma cholestanol level;
      the xanthomas regressed remarkably and the mental retardation improved in
      association with normalization of EEG findings during treatment with CDCA alone
      or in combination with pravastatin. However, during treatment with pravastatin
      alone, his tendon xanthomas enlarged again and slow waves reappeared on the EEG. 
      Because inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by treatment with the HMG-CoA
      reductase inhibitor alone was not effective in causing a reduction of
      cholestanol, the increase in plasma cholestanol levels in CTX may not have been
      solely due to increased cholesterol synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
PG  - 858-64
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare lipid storage disorder due to an
      autosomal-recessive inherited defect of the hepatic mitochondrial steroid
      26-hydroxylase. The resultant reduced biosynthesis of cholic and especially
      chenodeoxycholic acid and the increased production and accumulation of
      cholestanol and cholesterol in most tissues is described and pathogenetic aspects
      as well as typical pathological findings are discussed. In the light of three
      personal observations the clinical symptoms and the results of auxiliary
      investigations are discussed and compared with the literature. The suspected
      diagnosis of CTX may be confirmed by demonstration of a pathologically elevated
      concentration of cholestanol or biliary alcohols in serum and urine respectively.
      The chronically progressive neurologic deficit can be halted or is in some cases 
      partially reversible by treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Therefore, early
      diagnosis is mandatory and CTX should be considered in every patient presenting
      with intellectual impairment, spastic-ataxic signs, juvenile cataracts and tendon
      xanthomas.

TI  - [A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with spastic paraparesis, epilepsy, and
      bradykinesia].
PG  - 677-9
AB  - A 26-year-old female developed mental deterioration, general convulsion, cataract
      and spastic gait in order since her entrance into elementary school. A diagnosis 
      of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was made because of hypercholestanolemia.
      At the time of admission, cataract, a mild thickening of Achilles tendons, mental
      deterioration, spastic paraparesis, truncal ataxia, and bradykinesia were noted. 
      Bilateral slowing of 2 to 7 Hz was recorded in EEG, and brain CT and MRI revealed
      mild cerebellar atrophy. HVA and 5-HIAA levels in CSF were low. Oral
      administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, 300 mg per day, resulted in improvement 
      of bradykinesia and EEG abnormality, increase of HVA and 5-HIAA levels in CSF,
      and decrease of serum cholesterol level in two weeks. Bradykinesia observed in
      the present case is a rare clinical finding of CTX, and the improvement of
      bradykinesia soon after the treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid has not been
      reported yet. This case is important for elucidating the mechanism of
      neurological disorders in CTX.

TI  - Mutations in the bile acid biosynthetic enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase underlie
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 7779-83
AB  - The sterol storage disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is characterized
      by abnormal deposition of cholesterol and cholestanol in multiple tissues.
      Deposition in the central nervous system leads to neurological dysfunction marked
      by dementia, spinal cord paresis, and cerebellar ataxia. Deposition in other
      tissues causes tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and cataracts. In two
      unrelated patients with CTX, we have identified different point mutations in the 
      gene (CYP27) encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in the bile acid
      biosynthesis pathway. Transfection of mutant cDNAs into cultured cells results in
      the synthesis of immunoreactive sterol 27-hydroxylase protein with greatly
      diminished enzyme activity. We have localized the CYP27 gene to the q33-qter
      interval of human chromosome 2, and to mouse chromosome 1, in agreement with the 
      autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of CTX. These findings underscore the
      essential role played by sterols in the central nervous system and suggest that
      mutations in other sterol metabolizing enzymes may contribute to diseases with
      neurological manifestations.

AB  - We present the clinical and laboratory findings of 8 patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The clinical features consisted of a combination 
      of bilateral Achilles tendon xanthomas, cataracts, low intelligence, pyramidal
      signs, cerebellar signs, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy, foot deformity,
      cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis, EEG abnormality, and increased CSF
      protein. Increased cholesterol was present in the serum, CSF and red cell
      membrane of all 8 patients. The bile of one patient with late age onset of the
      disease showed an attenuated production of bile acids and bile alcohols. Three of
      the 7 had obstruction and/or marked narrowing of the coronary arteries. Data on
      136 patients reported throughout the world are reviewed.

TI  - [Hypothyroidism with increased serum levels of cholestanol and bile
      alcohol--analogous symptoms to cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
PG  - 402-6
AB  - We reported a 53-year-old woman with hypothyroidism due to ectopic thyroid gland.
      She showed intellectual impairment, bilateral pyramidal tract sings, slight
      cerebellar signs, and degenerative changes of brain white matter on CT and MRI,
      which were similar to symptoms and signs in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
      We found increases of serum cholestanol in the patient and additional 3 patients 
      with hypothyroidism. Total bile alcohol was also increased in the serum of the
      patients. We speculate that hypothyroidism and CTX might have a similar
      pathophysiological background on the development of neurological complications
      and atherosclerosis.

TI  - Use of determinations of 7-lathosterol (5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol) and other
      cholesterol precursors in serum in the study and treatment of disturbances of
      sterol metabolism, particularly cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 603-12
AB  - The sterol composition of sera from patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis 
      (CTX) was investigated by gas chromatographic analysis of saponified extracts,
      using a polar (CP Wax 52CB) and an apolar (CP Sil 5CB) capillary column. Apart
      from already known sterols, the presence of increased amounts of 8-lathosterol (5
      alpha-cholest-8(9)-en-3 beta-ol) and significant amounts of 8-dehydrocholesterol 
      (cholesta-5,8-dien-3 beta-ol) were noticed. The latter compound has not been
      detected previously in human serum and possibly represents a hitherto unknown
      cholesterol precursor. The apparently elevated levels of delta 8-sterols in CTX
      serum suggests partial inhibition of migration of the 8,9 double bond to the 7,8 
      position in this condition. The concentration of 7-lathosterol, an indicator of
      cholesterol production rate, is also highly elevated in CTX serum and quickly
      returns to normal values after oral bile acid therapy. Determinations of serum
      lathosterol are not only useful in the follow-up of therapy of CTX patients, but 
      also in the follow-up of hypercholesterolemic patients treated with either
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or bile acid sequestrants.

AB  - We report 3 sisters treated for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We treated one,
      with a severe neurologic form of the illness, with chenodeoxycholic acid, then
      lovastatin and simvastatin. These drugs had different efficacy and tolerance, but
      induced no clinical improvement. Her sisters, without neurologic symptoms,
      received chenodeoxycholic acid, which normalized the cholestanol level. Optimal
      treatment of this illness must begin before there is significant clinical
      symptomatology.

AB  - This report describes a case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) accompanied 
      by clinical manifestations of parkinsonism, including oily and masked face,
      marked akinesia, muscle rigidity and resting hand tremor. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the brain showed high intensity areas on T2 weighted imaging,
      and slightly low intensity areas on T1 weighted imaging in the right globus
      pallidus and the left putamen. Cerebral cortical atrophy with slight ventricular 
      dilatation and cerebellar atrophy were present as well. This is a case report of 
      CTX which manifested parkinsonism. Parkinsonism may not be a coincidental
      manifestation in CTX, but rather represent a symptom of the same underlying
      diathesis.

TI  - High levels of plant sterols and cholesterol precursors in cerebrotendinous

PG  - 223-9
AB  - We measured the cholestanol, cholesterol precursor (lathosterol), and plant
      sterol (campesterol and sitosterol) concentrations of serum and bile in 11
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The mean values of serum
      cholestanol, lathosterol, campesterol, and sitosterol were, respectively, 8.4-,
      2.5-, 2.7-, and 1.4-times higher in the patients than in normal control subjects 
      (n = 26). Cholestanol (6.7-fold) and campesterol (3.7-fold) levels in bile (n =
      4) were also elevated in the patients. There was no significant difference of
      serum sterol levels between patients with coronary artery disease and those
      without it. Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment for periods ranging from 6 months to 
      3 years and 4 months lowered serum lathosterol (57.7% reduction) and campesterol 
      (57.8%) levels in parallel with cholestanol (70.8%) level, but the sitosterol
      level (19.7%) decreased less. Thus, increased levels of cholesterol precursor
      (lathosterol), plant sterols (campesterol and sitosterol), and cholestanol were
      found in the serum and bile in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Chenodeoxycholic
      acid treatment effectively reduced the levels of these sterols, except for
      sitosterol.

AB  - Tendinous xanthomata with maximum expression on Achilles tendons are a
      characteristic feature of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a rare autosomal
      recessive lipid storage disease. Twenty patients are under review; three of them,
      at different stages of the disease, underwent computed tomographic (CT)
      examination. CT demonstrates with a high degree of accuracy the increased size of
      the tendon and its heterogeneous structure resulting from cholesterol and
      cholestanol crystal deposits.

PG  - 371-6
AB  - The authors report the clinical findings in 10 Italian cases of cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis (CTX). In addition to the classical neurological manifestations,
      the presence of psychiatric symptoms and osteopenia is stressed. Chronic
      treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid resulted in decreased plasma cholestanol
      levels and improvement of some central and peripheral neurophysiological
      parameters including EEG, VEP, SEP and conduction velocities. Due to the presence
      of cataracts, ischemic heart disease, premature atherosclerosis, mental
      deterioration and osteoporosis, usually found in old age, CTX can be considered a
      useful model of premature ageing.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare recessive inherited lipid storage 
      disease that was first described by Van Bogaert. Although the principal clinical 
      presentation affects the nervous system with dementia, spinal cord paresis,

      major biochemical abnormalities are expressed. The following sections deal with
      the pathogenesis and treatment of the biochemical problems in CTX.

TI  - Inborn errors of bile acid metabolism.
PG  - 478-96
AB  - Cholesterol is converted to cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid by a series of 
      reactions involving modifications to the steroid nucleus and oxidation of the
      side chain. These reactions can be affected by a number of inborn errors of
      metabolism. When this happens unusual bile acids or bile alcohols are
      synthesized; these can be identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry techniques. Two defects affecting the
      modifications to the steroid nucleus have been described; both present with
      cholestatic liver disease of neonatal onset. The better characterized of the
      two--3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency--leads to
      excretion of 3 beta-7 alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid and 3 beta,7 alpha,12
      alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid in the urine. The liver disease improves
      dramatically on treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Deficient activity of
      3-oxo-delta 4-steroid 5 beta-reductase is thought to be the cause of familial
      liver disease in some infants who excrete 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid 
      and 7 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid in the urine. However,
      diagnosis of this disorder is problematical; a similar pattern of metabolite
      excretion can occur as a result of liver damage caused by viruses or inborn
      errors of pathways unrelated to bile acid synthesis. Defective side chain
      oxidation in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) leads to
      synthesis of bile alcohols such as 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,25-tetrol and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol.
      Patients with CTX do not have cholestatic liver disease. Their major problems
      (neurological disease, atherosclerosis and xanthomata) are caused by accumulation
      of cholestanol and cholesterol in the tissues. Bile acid precursors are probably 
      diverted into synthesis of cholestanol. Chenodeoxycholic acid suppresses the
      production of abnormal metabolites from cholesterol (by inhibition of cholesterol
      7 alpha-hydroxylase) and leads to improvement in the neurological disease.
      Defective side chain oxidation also occurs in peroxisomal disorders but this time
      it leads to accumulation of C27 bile acids such as 3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid (trihydroxycoprostanic acid, THCA).
      This compound is readily detected in the bile and plasma of patients with defects
      of peroxisome biogenesis. In patients with defects of a single peroxisomal
      beta-oxidation enzyme (the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA component of the bifunctional
      protein or the thiolase), the major C27 bile acid in bile may be 3 alpha,7
      alpha,12 alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholestanoic acid (varanic acid).(ABSTRACT

PG  - 113-8
AB  - Deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were administered alternately to four 
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. During this oral therapy serum
      cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols were determined. Both showed a marked
      decrease after the start of the two different therapies. It can be concluded that
      not only chenodeoxycholic acid but also deoxycholic acid is able to suppress
      endogenous human bile acid synthesis, which is in accordance with other
      experiments describing the effect of feeding of various bile acids on endogenous 
      bile acid synthesis.

AB  - Urine from patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was found to
      contain a number of minor bile acids along with three major bile acids,
      7-epicholic acid, norcholic acid, and cholic acid. The following minor bile acids
      were identified by combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry:
      7-ketobisnordeoxycholic acid; 12-ketobisnorchenodeoxycholic acid;
      7-ketonordeoxycholic acid; 12-ketochenodeoxycholic acid; 7-ketodeoxycholic acid; 
      12-ketochendeoxycholic acid; bisnorcholic acid; allonorcholic acid; allocholic
      acid; 1 beta-hydroxybisnorcholic acid; 1 beta-hydroxynorcholic acid; 1
      beta-hydroxycholic acid; 2 beta-hydroxybisnorcholic acid; 2
      beta-hydroxy-norcholic acid; 2 beta-hydroxycholic acid. The presence of C22 and
      C23 bile acids in urine of the CTX patients suggests that bile alcohols having a 
      hydroxyl group at C22 or C23 in the side chain may be further degraded to these
      bile acids.

TI  - [Parkinsonism associated with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis].
PG  - 978-84
AB  - Two sibling cases of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with parkinsonism were
      reported. One was a woman of 39 years old, and another was her sister of 36 years
      old. In both cases, febrile convulsion appeared on 1.5 year old, and mental
      deterioration, ataxic -spastic gait, cataract and swelling of Achilles tendons
      developed in order since entrance into elementary school. Five years ago, while
      they were in hospital at the first time, they were diagnosed as cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis by mental disturbance, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract sign,
      histologically xanthomatous granuloma of Achilles tendons and
      hypercholestanolemia and family history of autosomal recessive trait. After the
      second admission, parkinsonism was noticed in addition to those findings above.
      Parkinsonism consisted of the following: Resting tremor of parkinsonian type,
      mild muscle rigidity of forearm and intrinsic-plus hand were observed in the
      elder sister, and generalized severe rigidity and bradykinesia in the younger
      sister. In both cases, brain CT showed the pontocerebellar atrophy, and the
      bilateral low density area in corona radiata, posterior portion of internal
      capsule, cerebral peduncle, tegmentum of midbrain and deep matter of cerebellum. 
      Brain MRI also showed abnormal intensity in the same regions as on the brain CT. 
      Administration of anti-parkinsonian drugs was challenged for the parkinsonism.
      Oral L-dopa test (500 mg) moderately improved parkinsonism in both cases. Therapy
      of diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (10 mg/day) entirely inhibited parkinsonian
      tremor and mild rigidity in the elder sister but was less effective for severe
      rigidity in the younger sister than administration of L-dopa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

TI  - 26-Hydroxycholesterol: synthesis, metabolism, and biologic activities.
PG  - 1527-33
AB  - Cholest-5-ene-3 beta,26-diol (26-hydroxycholesterol) is synthesized by a
      mitochondrial P-450 enzyme that appears to be widely distributed in tissues.
      Together with other C-27 steroid intermediates it is transported to the liver and
      metabolized to bile acids. Although 26-hydroxycholesterol is transported in
      plasma lipoproteins mostly as the fatty acid ester, neither its assembly and
      orientation within lipoproteins nor its mechanism of transport across the
      sinusoidal liver membrane is known. Cell culture studies indicate that
      26-hydroxycholesterol can inhibit both cholesterol synthesis and low density
      lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity. Inhibition of DNA synthesis also occurs and 
      may not be related to the reduction in HMG-CoA reductase activity. The
      relationship of these in vitro activities to the physiologic role(s) of
      26-hydroxycholesterol remains to be clarified. A clue to its biologic role is the
      knowledge that markedly decreased 26-hydroxylase activity appears to be the
      molecular basis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, an inborn error of metabolism 
      characterized by a significant decrease in 26-hydroxycholesterol and bile acid
      synthesis and an increase in cholesterol synthesis.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical, electrophysiological and nerve biopsy
      findings, and response to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 216-9
AB  - A 30-year-old patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was studied over a
      6-year period. The clinical manifestations were cataracts, intellectual
      deterioration, ataxia, palatal and pharyngeal myoclonus, corticospinal tract
      damage and an electrophysiologically demonstrated sensorimotor peripheral
      neuropathy. Peripheral motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity was slowed.
      Sural nerve biopsy revealed reduced densities of both myelinated and unmyelinated
      axons and teased fibres showed evidence of axonal regeneration and some
      remyelination. The loss of myelinated nerve fibres particularly affected those of
      larger diameter, thus contributing to the slowing of nerve conduction.
      Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment for two separate periods of 10 and 6 months each 
      increased nerve conduction velocity. This electrophysiological improvement was
      not matched by detectable clinical neurological improvement.

TI  - [A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with convulsive seizures].
PG  - 207-9
AB  - A 35 year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of convulsive seizures.
      His parents are first cousins. No other members of his family have similar
      symptoms. He showed mental retardation since childhood. At age 14, he had
      generalized convulsive seizures that were intractable. Bilateral cataracts were
      found and extracted at age 18. He noticed bilateral swellings at Achilles tendons
      at around 25 years of age. Physical examination revealed bilateral swellings of
      Achilles tendons. Neurologically, he showed poor intellectual ability,
      hyperreflexia with positive Babinski's sign and cerebellar ataxia. Marked
      elevations of cholestanol level (53.84 micrograms/ml; normal: 2.71 +/- 0.81, n = 
      17) and cholestanol/cholesterol ratio (2.20%; normal: 0.16 +/- 0.05, n = 17) were
      detected in serum. EEG showed abnormal background activities with bursts of high 
      voltage slow theta activities. MRI study showed high intensity lesions in globus 
      pallidus and multiple lesions in white matter with long spin echo sequence. Oral 
      administration of chenodeoxycholic acid improved EEG findings, serum cholestanol 
      level and convulsive seizures. However, the MRI abnormalities remained unchanged,
      which suggested irreversible brain damage. We reviewed the previous reports of
      144 cases of CTX. Fourteen cases had convulsive seizures. We stress that CTX is
      one the causes of symptomatic epilepsy.

AB  - The identification of a major biliary and plasma bile alcohol glucuronide, 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol-3-0-beta-D-glucuronide,
      present in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) patients, was investigated by
      positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). The spectrum was
      characterized by abundant ions formed by attachment of a proton, [M + H]+, or of 
      alkali ions, [M + Na]+ and [M + 39K]+, to the glucuronide salt. These ions
      allowed an unambiguous deduction of the molecular weight of the sample. It is
      suggested that FAB-MS could be used in the rapid diagnosis of CTX.

      the cholestanol level and the normal cholestanol/cholesterol ratio in his serum
      and tendon. The pathomechanism for some of the clinical manifestations in type
      IIa hyperlipoproteinemia and CTX might be caused by a common biochemical
      disturbance.

TI  - The reactivity of desmosterol and other shellfish- and xanthomatosis-associated
      sterols in the macrophage sterol esterification reaction.
PG  - 1713-21
AB  - The acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) reaction in macrophages is a
      critical step in atherosclerotic foam cell formation, but little is known about
      the reaction's sterol substrate specificity. In this report we examine the
      macrophage ACAT reactivity of the shellfish sterol, desmosterol, and other
      sterols found in man because of shellfish ingestion or in association with the
      foam cell diseases sitosterolemia and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). We
      first show that the J774 macrophage, a foam cell model with a hyperactive ACAT
      pathway, synthesizes desmosterol instead of cholesterol and that both endogenous 
      and exogenous desmosterol are substrates and stimulators of the ACAT reaction in 
      these cells. When exogenous desmosterol was added to human monocyte-derived
      macrophages, ACAT was stimulated 29- and 4-fold compared with control and
      cholesterol-treated cells, respectively. Steryl ester mass accumulation in
      desmosterol-treated human macrophages was 10-fold greater than in control cells
      and 3-fold greater than in cholesterol-treated cells. Another shellfish sterol,
      24-methylene cholesterol, also stimulated ACAT in human macrophages, but most of 
      the xanthomatosis-related sterols did not stimulate ACAT. These data suggest
      that: (a) the shellfish sterols desmosterol and 24-methylene cholesterol may be
      atherogenic; and (b) the excessive foam cell formation seen in sitosterolemia and
      CTX cannot be explained by ACAT hyperreactivity of their associated sterols.

TI  - Chenodeoxycholic acid normalizes elevated lipoprotein secretion and catabolism in
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare inherited lipid storage disease
      caused by a defect in bile acid synthesis in which cholesterol and its product
      cholestanol are deposited in neurological and vascular tissue. Therapy with
      chenodeoxycholic acid but not with the 7 beta-epimeric ursodeoxycholic acid is
      usually successful. In an untreated patient, total and low density lipoprotein
      (LDL) cholesterol were found to be low (134 +/- 11 and 78 +/- 8 mg/dl,
      respectively). The production rate (PR) and fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of
      very low density (VLDL) apolipoprotein B (apoB) were, however, both markedly
      increased (34.7 mg/kg per day and 13.7 pools/day, respectively vs. 15.1 +/- 5.0
      mg/kg per day and 6.2 +/- 3.8 pools/day in controls) while the PR and FCR of LDL 
      apoB were moderately elevated (16.3 mg/kg per day and 0.65 pools/day,
      respectively vs. 12.9 +/- 1.2 mg/kg per day and 0.52 +/- 0.10 pools/day in
      controls). After 1 month of 750 mg/day of chenodeoxycholic acid, the FCR and PR
      of both VLDL and LDL apoB became normal while total plasma cholesterol increased 
      significantly to 145 +/- 18 mg/dl. In a second patient who had been receiving 750
      mg/day of chenodeoxycholic acid for 6 months lipoprotein kinetics were normal.
      These parameters did not change when the subject was switched to 750 mg/day
      ursodeoxycholic acid. We postulate that cholesterol biosynthesis in CTX is
      derepressed by a diminished hepatic pool of chenodeoxycholic acid and that the
      elevated secretion of apoB is a response to the increased rate of cholesterol
      production.

TI  - [Effect of LDL-apheresis on a case of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis].
PG  - 196-201
AB  - Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familial disease characterized by 
      tendon-xanthomas, cataracts, progressive cerebellar ataxia, dementia and an
      elevation of serum cholestanol with normal levels of cholesterol. Although the
      pathogenesis of CTX is not fully understood, increment of cholestanol is
      suggested one of the major metabolic derangements of the disease. Recently, the
      LDL-apheresis has been developed as a new therapeutical equipment in the field of
      hyperlipidemia and been widely used to reduce the levels of LDL-cholesterol by
      selective LDL adsorption. From the point of view that cholestanol is involved
      mainly in LDL-cholesterol (1.019 less than d less than 1.063), we used this
      LDL-apheresis in the aim of reducing the cholestanol in 58 years old woman with
      typical sign and symptoms of CTX. The levels of serum cholestanol and cholesterol
      before the treatment with LDL-apheresis, were 10.7 micrograms/ml and 175 mg/dl
      respectively. Also the ratio of cholestanol/cholesterol indicated 0.63. By the
      first procedure of apheresis, the level of cholestanol was markedly decreased to 
      5.2 micrograms/ml (50%). Several LDL-apheresis treatments were carried out once a
      month. During 5 months treatments, neurological deterioration was arrested,
      dementia which included disorientation and recent-memory loss, cleaned a little. 
      Although the xanthomas did not decrease in size, this patients was better
      oriented to person, place, time and was able to speak rationally, 2nd her
      cerebellar dysfunction revealed improvement. From our new experiments-we believe 
      that the LDL-apheresis offers the strong hope of preventing the progress on
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 55-74
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare familial lipid storage that is caused by
      a defect in bile acid synthesis. As a result, large amounts of cholestanol, the 5
      alpha-dihydro derivative of cholesterol, accumulate in virtually every tissue,
      with extra large deposits in the nervous system, xanthomas, and bile. Clinically,
      progressive neurologic dysfunction, tendon xanthomas, cataracts, and
      atherosclerosis are commonly found. Because chenodeoxycholic acid, a primary bile
      acid, is almost devoid from the bile, replacement therapy (750 mg per day)
      suppresses abnormal bile acid synthesis, reduces elevated cholestanol synthesis
      and plasma concentrations, and improves neurologic function in this disease.

      Histochemical and ultrastructural study with evidence of its ceroid nature.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - A case is described of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with purely neurological
      manifestations. Cholestanol deposition in both affected and unaffected brain
      regions was markedly increased, reaching 18.5-20.8% of the sterol fraction. The
      unilateral lesions localized in the basal ganglia and cerebellar white matter
      featured perivascular accumulation of foam cells containing apolar lipid and
      ceroid. Necrosis with lipid-rich debris was a frequent finding often accompanied 
      by prominent collagen deposition. Within these lesions there were numerous
      refractile thick membranes which, according to lipid histochemical techniques,
      could be qualified as ceroid-type lipopigment. It is suggested that the ceroid
      membranes arise extracellularly directly from the lipid-rich debris.
      Ultrastructurally, they were composed of convolutes of highly organized
      trilaminar membranes about 15 nm thick similar to those seen in intracellular
      ceroid granules. The membranes were embedded in an amorphous substance of low or 
      medium density and were identical in their general appearance, stainability and
      fine structure to the membranocystic lesion in Nasu-Hakola disease and to the
      extracellular ceroid in atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  - So-called membranocystic lesion (MCL)--a new variant of ceroid type lipopigment.
PG  - 191-206; discussion 207
AB  - Structures very close morphologically to the so-called membranocystic formations 
      of the Nasu-Hakola's disease and identical in histochemical properties with them 
      were found in several other metabolically unrelated conditions such as
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (perivascularly in the brain) and in human
      atheromatous plaques. This with some other literary data points to unspecific
      nature of the membranocystic lesion (MCL) which also has been resisting
      satisfactory classification in terms of pathobiochemistry. Evidence is presented 
      suggesting the MCL is lipopigment in nature. This is based on its lipid
      histochemical properties dominated by prominent autofluorescence and marked
      sudanophilia resistant to lipid extraction procedures. Ultrastructural pattern of
      the MCL was membranous, being dominated by mostly individual trilaminar membranes
      about 15 nm thick which could be also occasionally identified in various
      intralysosomal ceroid type lipopigments. It is supposed that the MCL lipopigment 
      is formed mainly extracellularly from the lipid rich debris.

TI  - Studies on inborn errors of metabolism in Norway.
PG  - I164-8
AB  - Some 50 years ago, Muller described hypercholesterolemia, xanthomas, and coronary
      heart disease as symptoms of a genetic disorder. In the 1930s, other important
      discoveries concerning inborn errors of metabolism were made in Norway. Folling
      described phenylketonuria, and Refsum examined his first patients with
      heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis (phytanic acid storage disease). Several 
      other inborn errors of metabolism have been discovered in Norway: familial
      lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, methylmalonic acidemia,
      beta-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase deficiency, pyroglutamic aciduria, and
      N-acetyl aspartic aciduria. Metabolic and biochemical studies in these patients
      have revealed new and important metabolic pathways. Studies on patients with
      inborn errors not first described in Norway have also given important information
      on key enzymes in metabolic pathways. Thus, studies on patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and those with Zellweger's syndrome have revealed 
      the normal metabolic route for conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. The
      discoveries and the clinical and biochemical research in former days were mostly 
      good examples of serendipity combined with excellent clinical alertness. In more 
      recent years, several of the discoveries have resulted from systematic
      biochemical screening of urine, plasma, or other body fluids from patients with
      unusual clinical syndromes.

TI  - Cyclosporine, low-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol.
PG  - 1012-21
AB  - Lipoproteins are known to be able to transport a variety of drugs. This report
      suggests that low-density lipoprotein not only functions as an important carrier 
      of cyclosporine in plasma but also facilitates transport of cyclosporine across
      the cell membrane by means of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Such a
      mechanism would explain (1) the similar tissue distribution of cyclosporine and
      the low-density lipoprotein receptor, (2) the increase in immunosuppression and
      toxicity with low total serum cholesterol levels, and (3) the relative absence of
      immunosuppression and toxicity with high levels of cyclosporine in the blood in
      patients with hypertriglyceridemia. In addition to receptor-mediated uptake, a
      disturbance of the blood-brain barrier is suggested as an explanation of the high
      frequency of cyclosporine-induced central nervous system toxicity after liver
      transplantation. Cyclosporine-induced inhibition of the mitochondrial steroid
      26-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the formation of bile acids from
      cholesterol and deficient in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, may
      cause or contribute to the observed central nervous system toxicity. It also may 
      explain the similar clinical features of cyclosporine-induced central nervous
      system toxicity and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 425-9
AB  - C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase activity in fibroblasts from two heterozygotes for CTX
      was determined, using an optimized enzyme assay. With 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7
      alpha,12 alpha-triol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha-diol, 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholestane-3-one or 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol as substrates, the
      activities were about 50% of those of control cells. The Km for the substrates
      was not increased in the CTX heterozygotes. These findings support that
      deficiency of the C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase is the primary enzymatic defect in
      CTX.

      tract and posterior column could be evaluated separately with these two
      techniques. Percutaneous electrical stimulation technique would be useful for
      investigating conduction in the corticospinal tract in patients with spinal cord 
      disorders.

TI  - Plasma and biliary cholestanol related to steroid metabolism in familial

PG  - 197-205
AB  - Plasma cholestanol is increased in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and in
      sitosterolemia with xanthomatosis. We measured plasma and biliary cholestanol in 
      heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients with (n = 10) and without (n 
      = 12) ileal exclusion. In the unoperated patients plasma cholestanol
      concentration (12.9 mumol/l) and content (1.2 mmol/mol cholesterol) were slightly
      higher than in the nonhypercholesterolemic control subjects studied by us. Ileal 
      exclusion had lowered plasma cholestanol concentration but only in proportion to 
      the lowering of plasma cholesterol concentration, and plasma cholestanol content 
      (mmol/mol cholesterol) was similar in the operated and unoperated subjects.
      Plasma and biliary cholestanol contents were positively associated. In the
      unoperated patients the fractional cholesterol absorption and plasma plant
      sterols, also reflecting sterol absorption, were positively correlated with
      plasma cholestanol content. Our study suggests, that plasma cholestanol is
      slightly elevated in familial hypercholesterolemia and that, in addition to
      plasma lipoprotein level, sterol absorption is important in the regulation of
      plasma cholestanol level. Ileal exclusion decreases plasma cholestanol in
      proportion to the decrement in the plasma cholesterol concentration.

TI  - Clinical biochemistry of peroxisomal disorders.
PG  - 57-80
AB  - Peroxisomes have been shown to participate in a variety of pathological
      processes. Peroxisomal anomalities are central features of Zellweger's
      cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum's 
      disease and several other genetic metabolic disorders (pseudo-Zellweger syndrome,
      Leber congenital amaurosis, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, rhizomelic
      chondrodysplasia punctata). In disorders with general loss of peroxisomal
      functions (Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum's 
      disease) an accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids and pathological bile
      acids are found. Patients have a defective synthesis of plasmalogens and show
      increased excretion of dicarboxylic acids of medium chain length and of pipecolic
      acid in the urine. These anomalities which are due to the lack of peroxisomal
      enzymes, supply the basis for clinical laboratory tests. The study of these
      peroxisomal disorders has presented valuable information on the normal function
      of peroxisomes.

TI  - Psychiatric disorders in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 354-7
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a familial recessive disorder. Patients with
      the disorder present with tendon xanthomas, juvenile cataracts, dementia, and
      pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities but have normal plasma cholesterol. High
      plasma cholestanol concentrations and abnormal bile acid metabolism are specific 
      for this disease. The authors describe four patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis and prominent psychiatric symptoms. In three of these patients
      appropriate diagnosis and treatment were delayed for years because the presence
      of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was not recognized. Early recognition of this
      potentially lethal disease is important because both the psychiatric and
      neurological symptoms respond to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid.

TI  - Effect of cholestanol feeding on sterol concentrations in the serum, liver, and
      cerebellum of mice.
PG  - 375-9
AB  - In order to elucidate the mechanism of xanthoma formation in cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis, mice were fed for 32 weeks with a diet rich in 5 alpha-cholestan-3
      beta-ol (cholestanol) (1%, w/w). The concentrations of sterols in the serum,
      liver, and cerebellum were determined using high performance liquid
      chromatography. In the cholestanol-fed mice, the cholestanol concentrations in
      the serum and liver reached maxima in the first 2 to 4 weeks; the levels were
      about 30- to 100-fold higher than in the control diet mice. The cholestanol
      concentrations declined thereafter, finally to 50-60% of the maxima. Cholesterol 
      concentrations were slightly lower in the cholestanol-fed mice throughout the
      experiments than in the control diet mice. On the other hand, the levels of
      cholestanol in the cerebellum increased almost linearly in parallel to the
      feeding time, and no decline was observed. These results suggest that the
      capacity of the liver to remove or degrade cholestanol was increased by long-term
      intake of this compound, whereas the cerebellum had no such feed-back regulation.
      Histological examinations using an electron microscope revealed the enlargement
      of lysosomal granules in the liver of the cholestanol-fed mice.

TI  - Hepatic 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of bile acid intermediates, and its significance 
      for the pathogenesis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 157-64
AB  - The bile acid precursor 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was found to be
      enzymatically dehydroxylated at a slow rate by liver tissues from the rat, human,
      and guinea pig. The rat liver enzyme is localized in the microsomal fraction, has
      a pH optimum of about 8.5, an apparent Km of 0.03-0.04 mM, and a Vmax of 10-15
      nmoles.mg protein-1.hr-1. The product from 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was 
      identified as cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one by its chromatographic properties and by
      mass spectrometry. The reaction proceeded both in air and N2, and pyridine
      nucleotides were not required as cofactors. In addition to the enzymatic
      reaction, there was a significant nonenzymatic dehydroxylation of 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, in particular at high pH and with high
      concentrations of protein. No 7 alpha-dehydroxylation occurred with various 7
      alpha-hydroxylated 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-steroids. We have previously shown that
      at least part of the accumulation of cholestanol in cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) is due to accelerated 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of bile acid
      intermediate(s), which are further converted into cholestanol. The capacity to
      dehydroxylate 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was found to be about the same in
      homogenates of liver biopsies from two patients with CTX as in preparations from 
      control subjects. It is suggested that increased levels of substrate (7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) in the liver, rather than increased amounts of 7
      alpha-dehydroxylase is the explanation for the accelerated 7
      alpha-dehydroxylation in CTX that leads to increased biosynthesis of cholestanol.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a review of biochemical findings of the patient
      population in The Netherlands.
PG  - 56-75
AB  - This study gives a review of the results obtained from biochemical investigations
      of 20 patients in The Netherlands suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, 
      an inborn error of metabolism in bile acid synthesis. Diagnosis can best be
      established by determining the excretion of urinary bile alcohols, in particular 
      5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha,23,25-pentol, in urine by means of
      capillary gas chromatography. Measurement of serum cholestanol levels or serum
      cholestanol/cholesterol ratios, commonly used for establishing cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis, are not reliable. The effectiveness of the different therapies,
      i.e. administration of bile acids, can be evaluated by monitoring the urinary
      excretion of bile alcohols. From such investigations it was concluded that cholic
      acid especially, but also chenodeoxycholic acid are the therapies of choice for
      the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. All patients, until now
      diagnosed in The Netherlands were not discovered before the third or fourth
      decade of life because the characteristic signs only then become manifest
      clearly. Unfortunately, because sterol storage is almost irreversible, therapy
      only results in minor improvements of the patient's condition. Therefore early
      detection of the presence of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is desirable so that 
      treatment can start before extensive storage of sterols is a fact. We developed
      some laboratory assays with the purpose of early detection. One consists of the
      detection of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis carriers by subjecting them to oral
      cholestyramine administration and monitoring the urinary excretion of the bile
      alcohol 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol before and after 
      treatment. Secondly, a relatively simple screening test for cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis was developed based on an enzymatic assay of 7 alpha-hydroxylated
      steroids in urine. After suitable modification this assay in principle allows the
      screening of large populations for the existence of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis and thus to detect the disease at an earlier stage of life.

      The three patients presented tendinous xanthoma and cataract. The neurologic
      disorders were different in each case. The first one, a 43 years old woman
      suffered from dementia, ataxia and pseudobulbar palsy: CT scan showed cerebellar 
      hypodense lesions. After the apparition of bulbar signs ans cachexia she died at 
      45. The second patient, a 39 years old man had an ataxia and mild psychiatric
      disorders. He was stabilized with a treatment of chenodesoxycholic acid. The
      third one, a 49 years old women suffered only from tendinous xanthoma, cataract, 
      and had no neurological disorder. His plasmatic cholestanol level was high. CTX
      is a recessive deficit of the hepatic 26 hydroxylase with deposits of abnormal
      metabolites in tendons, crystalline lenses and central nervous system. Reviewing 
      the 44 observations of CTX in the literature, the authors define the genetical,
      clinical, biochemical and therapeutical aspects of CTX, and underline the
      necessity of a early diagnosis with cholestanol dosage, before the apparition of 
      neurological disorders and the short terminal phase. CTX is a rare but
      fortunately treatable neurolipidosis.

AB  - The present paper is a histological, histochemical and electron microscopic study
      of biopsied specimens from both right and left Achilles tendon, sural nerve and
      gastrocnemius muscle in a case of peripheral neuropathy with decreased sensory
      conduction velocity within a cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis confirmed
      biochemically in a 29-year-old woman. The tendon specimens contained large
      deposits of complex, non-homogeneous lipids, distributed intra- and
      extracellularly. The right sural nerve specimen showed a very severe neuropathy
      with massive diffuse myelinated fiber loss, presence of foamy macrophages and
      lipid droplets in Schwann cells. Segmental de- and remyelination was noted in 17%
      of the teased myelinated fibers. No onion bulbs were observed. Two years later,
      the left sural nerve specimen revealed a mild diffuse myelinated fiber loss, a
      more active segmental de- and remyelination (23%) without onion bulbs, and an
      active regeneration. Lipid storage aspects were absent. The gastrocnemius muscle 
      specimens exhibited slight alterations of neurogenic origin. The pathogenesis of 
      this neuropathy is discussed.

TI  - Metabolism of the cholestanol precursor cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one in different
      tissues.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease where the basic
      defect is a lack of the mitochondrial C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase involved in bile
      acid synthesis (EC 1.14.13.15). Cholestanol and cholesterol accumulate in all
      tissues. At least part of the accumulation of cholestanol is due to a 7
      alpha-dehydroxylation of early bile acid intermediates. Cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one, 
      a proposed intermediate in this pathway, is found in increased concentrations in 
      serum of the patients. This study shows that cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one may be
      metabolized to 4-cholesten-3-one and cholestanol by liver, adrenals and brain. No
      conversion was found in intestinal mucosa or in kidneys. The capacity to convert

TI  - Normal activity of C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase in cultured sitosterolaemia
      fibroblasts.
PG  - 701-4
AB  - The primary defect in sitosterolaemia is unknown. In some patients excretion of
      bile alcohols is increased, and it has been suggested that the defect is located 
      to some step in the biosynthesis of bile acids. The activity of C27-steroid
      26-hydroxylase was measured in cultured skin fibroblasts from a sitosterolaemic
      patient. The same assay was used as before in demonstrating deficiency of this
      enzyme activity in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a disease in which high 
      excretion of bile alcohols is typical. The substrate, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7
      alpha,12 alpha-triol, was 26-hydroxylated to the same extent in the patient cells
      as in those of healthy controls. Thus, the sitosterolaemia cells have a normal
      activity of this enzyme.

TI  - Increased plasma bile alcohol glucuronides in patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis: effect of chenodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 1006-12
AB  - Large quantities of C27 bile alcohols hydroxylated at C-25 are excreted in the
      bile and urine of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a lipid storage
      disease that results from defective bile acid synthesis. The presence of both
      biliary and urinary bile alcohols reflects impaired bile acid synthesis. After
      treatment of samples with beta-glucuronidase, plasma bile alcohols were
      quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 5 beta-Cholestane-3
      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol (334 micrograms/dl) was found to be the major
      bile alcohol, followed by 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,23R,25-pentol (65 micrograms/dl), and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 
      alpha,24(R and S),25-pentols (62.5 micrograms/dl and 64.5 micrograms/dl,
      respectively) in the plasma of these patients. When compared to biliary and
      urinary bile alcohol excretions, the plasma pattern resembled bile where 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol glucuronide predominated. In
      contrast, urinary bile alcohols were composed chiefly of 5 beta-cholestanepentol 
      glucuronides with only small amounts of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,25-tetrol glucuronide. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, which
      suppresses abnormal bile acid synthesis in these patients, reduced plasma bile
      alcohol concentrations dramatically. These results show that large quantities of 
      bile alcohol glucuronides, particularly 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,25-tetrolglucuronide, circulate in plasma of patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis. The plasma bile alcohols closely resemble biliary bile alcohols
      which indicates their hepatic origin. The large quantities of polyhydroxylated
      bile alcohols in the urine may suggest their formation, at least in part, from 5 
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol by renal hydroxylating
      mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A method for the simultaneous determination of 5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol and
      cholesterol in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography was developed.
      After addition of internal standard (5 beta-cholestan-3 alpha-ol) and
      saponification with ethanolic potassium hydroxide, the sterols were converted
      into their benzoyl derivatives, which were subjected to reversed-phase liquid
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection at 228 nm. Only 0.1 ml of serum was
      needed to give a reproducible result. This method has been used for the
      biochemical diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a hereditary disorder of
      cholesterol metabolism.

      acid.
PG  - 1233-8
AB  - We investigated the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on cerebrospinal fluid sterol
      and protein composition in six patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a
      progressive neurologic disease, and in 11 control subjects. In the cerebrospinal 
      fluid from the controls, the mean (+/- SD) levels of cholesterol and cholestanol 
      were 400 +/- 300 and 4 +/- 7 micrograms per deciliter, respectively. The levels
      were almost 1.5 and 20 times higher in cerebrospinal fluid from untreated
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Cholestanol levels were also
      markedly elevated in the plasma of untreated patients, but their plasma
      cholesterol levels (215 +/- 61 mg per deciliter) were not different from control 
      values. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid reduced cerebrospinal fluid
      cholesterol by 34 percent and cholestanol threefold. Plasma cholestanol levels
      also decreased sharply. Normal cerebrospinal fluid contained small quantities of 
      albumin, apolipoproteins, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. In
      cerebrospinal fluid from untreated patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, 
      immunoreactive apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein B fragment was increased about 
      100-fold and albumin about 3.5-fold; apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein D, and
      lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase were 1.5 to 3 times more concentrated.
      Apolipoprotein AIV and apolipoprotein E concentrations were comparable to those
      in controls, and apolipoprotein AII was considerably decreased. During treatment,
      the concentrations of albumin and apolipoproteins AI and B declined. These
      results suggest that increased cerebrospinal fluid sterols are derived from
      plasma lipoproteins by means of a defective blood-brain barrier in patients with 
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid reestablished 
      selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier and normalized the
      concentrations of sterol and apolipoprotein in the cerebrospinal fluid.

TI  - Determination of some hydroxycholesterols in human serum samples.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - The simultaneous determination of some hydroxycholesterols in human serum samples
      is described. The procedure is based on hydrolysis and extraction of these
      compounds in serum samples, followed by removal of especially cholesterol (making
      use of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography) and derivatization 
      of the purified compounds to their trimethylsilyl ethers and subsequent gas
      chromatography using flame ionization detection. Serum levels of 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol and 26-hydroxycholesterol
      were determined in several groups of patients: normals, untreated patients
      suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, patients suffering from
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and treated with either chenodeoxycholic acid or
      cholic acid in an effective dose, patients suffering from cerebro-hepato-renal
      syndrome, patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia and treated with
      cholestyramine for prolonged periods and one patient presumed to be suffering
      from an inborn error of metabolism in bile acid synthesis. It can be concluded
      that the 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol concentration in serum is a good parameter
      for establishing disorders involving the metabolic conversion of 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol towards bile acids. In addition, 26-hydroxycholesterol
      levels in patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are beyond
      detectable limits, even during treatment with bile acids in an effective dose,
      whereas in all other conditions this compound is substantially present.

TI  - Low-density lipoprotein metabolism in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 270-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare disorder characterized by a defect
      in conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, increased plasma levels of
      cholestanol, and accumulations of sterols in tendons, brain, and coronary
      arteries. Despite the presence of tendon xanthomas, patients with CTX frequently 
      have low levels of plasma cholesterol and low density lipoproteins (LDL). The
      mechanisms for a low LDL are not understood. The present study, therefore, was
      carried out to examine the metabolism of LDL in a 58-year-old black man with CTX.
      This particular patient had an LDL-cholesterol in the mid-normal range (149 +/- 6
      mg/dL). Nonetheless, his fractional catabolic rate (FCR) for LDL-apolipoprotein
      (apo-LDL) was 0.45 pools/d, which was increased compared to 15 aged-matched men
      (FCR, 0.30 +/- 0.01 pools/d). His production rate for apo-LDL (18.5 mg/kg-d) also
      was increased compared to those of middle-aged men (13.5 +/- 2.5 mg/kg-d). Since 
      the underlying defect in CTX can be reversed by administration of
      chenodeoxycholic acid (chenodiol), the patient was treated with chenodiol (250 mg
      4X daily), and measurements of LDL kinetics were repeated. During chenodiol
      therapy, his LDL-cholesterol concentration rose significantly to 165 +/- 12
      mg/dL; his FCR for apo-LDL fell to 0.29 pools/d; and his production rate of
      apo-LDL declined to 14.4 mg/kg-d. We postulate that chenodiol suppressed the
      excessive synthesis of cholesterol and bile acids, which had two effects. It
      curtailed both the overproduction of LDL and the excessive synthesis of LDL
      receptors, the latter being responsible for the high FCR of apo-LDL in the
      untreated state.

TI  - Accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one in 
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effect of treatment with
      chenodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 266-71
AB  - Evidence was recently presented that an essential part of the accumulation of
      cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is due to
      acceleration of a novel pathway, involving 7 alpha-hydroxylated intermediates in 
      bile acid biosynthesis as precursors (J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75:448-456). Such
      intermediates accumulate in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis due to
      lack of the mitochondrial 26-hydroxylase involved in the major pathway for bile
      acid biosynthesis. The new pathway may involve the following steps: 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol----7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one----cholesta-4,6-
      dien-3-one----4-cholesten-3-one----cholestanol. Accurate methods have been
      developed for assay of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and
      cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one in serum, based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry.
      The serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as well as those of
      cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one were found to be markedly elevated in the three patients 
      with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Treatment of two of the patients with
      chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the serum levels of the two steroids by more than
      80%. The concentration of cholestanol was reduced by 72% in one patient and by
      48% in the other. The possibility is discussed that accumulation of cholestanol
      in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is secondary to accumulation of 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one.

TI  - Abnormal urinary bile acids in a patient suffering from cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis during oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 238-46
AB  - The urinary bile acid profile, obtained by capillary gas chromatography, of a
      patient suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and treated with
      ursodeoxycholic acid demonstrated, besides the occurrence of 23-norcholic acid
      and (23R)-hydroxycholic acid (as a consequence of this disease), six additional
      unknown bile acids and three known bile acids, viz. ursodeoxycholic acid,
      hyocholic acid and omega-muricholic acid. The structure of two of the unknown
      bile acids were elucidated and proven by organic syntheses. These were
      23-norursodeoxycholic acid and 3 beta-ursodeoxycholic acid. The structures of
      three bile acids were tentatively elucidated as being 1
      beta-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid, 21-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid and
      22-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid, and the possibility that the structure of the
      remaining bile acid is that of 5-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid is discussed. Two of
      these bile acids (1 beta-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid and 5-hydroxyursodeoxycholic
      acid) also occurred in urine of a healthy individual during oral ursodeoxycholic 
      acid treatment, whereas 23-norcholic acid, 23-norursodeoxycholic acid,
      (23R)-hydroxycholic acid, 21-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid and
      22-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid were only present in urine of the patient
      suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The metabolism of ursodeoxycholic 
      acid, both in the normal state and in the cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, is
      discussed.

TI  - Malabsorption of liposoluble vitamins in a child with bile acid deficiency.
PG  - 33-41
AB  - A male born to first cousins presented at 12 months with hypocalcemic
      convulsions, rickets, epistaxis due to vitamin K deficiency, and extremely low
      serum levels of beta-carotene and vitamin A. Liver function was altered
      moderately (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, 55 U/L; glutamic-pyruvic
      transaminase, 37 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 255 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 437
      U/L). To correct the deficiencies, 8,000 IU vitamin D/day, 10,000 IU vitamin
      A/day, and intramuscular administration of vitamin K1 were required. At 9 years, 
      he presented signs of neuromuscular affection, and the serum vitamin E level
      (measured for the first time) was extremely low. Classic lipid malabsorption
      syndromes (abetalipoproteinemia, chronic cholestasis, mucoviscidosis, coeliac
      disease, Whipple's disease) were excluded by appropriate examinations.
      Composition of duodenal bile acids was characterized by undetectable levels of
      cholic acid metabolites, and only chenodeoxycholic acid metabolites were present.
      Serum total bile acid concentration was normal, with an atypical low cholic
      acid/chenodeoxycholic acid ratio and abnormal presence of 3 beta-OH-delta
      5-cholenic acid and 6-OH-bile acids. Urinary bile acid composition was also
      characterized by elevated 6-OH-bile acids. Known enzymopathies of the bile acid
      synthetic pathway were excluded (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis,
      cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome of Zellweger, coprostanic acidemia). Bile acid pool
      sizes were determined by using stable isotopes: cholic acid pool size [2.90 (N,
      32 +/- 16) microM/kg] and chenodeoxycholic acid pool size [10.8 (N, 32.6 +/- 9.9)
      microM/kg] were extremely low; fractional turnover rates of both bile acids were 
      in a normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      in The Netherlands.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - The clinical features and additional investigations of 20 Dutch patients
      suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), an inborn error of
      metabolism in bile acid synthesis, are described. The onset was in the second or 
      third decade. The clinical picture at the time of examination consisted of a
      combination of two or more of the following signs: cataract, xanthoma of a
      tendon, mental deterioration, pyramidal tract signs, cerebellar signs and
      epilepsy. Mental retardation was reported in patients. CT-scanning showed
      cerebellar hypodensity in 8 out of 16 patients but this feature did not correlate
      well with cerebellar signs. The EEG was abnormal in all but one patient.
      Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid resulted in a normalization of EEG and
      biochemical abnormalities but not of the clinical signs. Cholic acid was equally 
      effective but had much less side effects. The importance of a diagnosis in early 
      life is stressed as well as the examination of clinically unaffected heterozygous
      relatives.

      to screen urines from normal subjects, liver-transplant recipients, and patients 
      with various liver diseases, cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome, or cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX). Because of their high concentrations of 7 alpha-hydroxylated
      compounds excreted, the CTX patients were clearly distinguished from all other
      groups except for a slight overlap with the patients with cerebro-hepato-renal
      syndrome and liver-transplant recipients. Gas chromatography for bile alcohols
      completed the differential diagnosis.

TI  - Effects of cholestanol feeding and cholestyramine treatment on the tissue sterols
      in the rabbit.
PG  - 738-43
AB  - Rabbits were fed diets enriched with cholestanol or cholesterol (3.5 g/wk) for
      4-12 weeks. During cholestanol feeding, the concentration of cholestanol in blood
      serum, liver, heart and aorta increased 15-30 times. In serum and liver, the
      concentration of cholesterol also increased. Cholestanol-fed rabbits developed
      inflammatory changes in the liver, with proliferation of small bile ducts. Liver 
      tests were only slightly abnormal. Morphological atherosclerosis of the aorta was
      only occasionally seen in rabbits receiving cholestanol for eight weeks or less. 
      During cholesterol feeding, the amounts of cholesterol in different tissues
      increased dramatically, most in the aorta. Morphological atherosclerosis in the
      aorta was found in all rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched diets for more than four 
      weeks. Brain cholestanol was doubled in rabbits fed cholestanol for eight weeks, 
      whereas brain sterols did not change significantly during cholesterol feeding.
      After an additional regression period with cholestyramine for eight weeks, the
      increased content of cholestanol in the brain was unchanged in cholestanol-fed
      rabbits. These observations are discussed in relation to the cholestanolosis of
      the brain that develops in the rare inherited human disease cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.

AB  - The configuration at C-25 in 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12
      alpha,25,26-pentol isolated from the bile and feces of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomtosis (CTX) was determined from the lanthanide-induced
      circular dichroism (CD) Cotton effects and 13C-NMR measurements. Under anhydrous 
      conditions, CD spectra of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12
      alpha,25,26-pentol in the presence of Eu(fod)3 exhibited a large induced negative
      Cotton effect at 320 nm. On the basis of the empirical rule
      (primary-tertiary-alpha-diols) in which R compounds have positive Cotton effects 
      and S compounds have negative Cotton effects at 320 nm, it was concluded that
      25,26-pentol has the 1,2,glycol structure with C-25 having the S-configuration.
      This assignment was based upon comparison with model compounds, 25(R and
      S),26-dihydroxy cholesterols and 25(R and S),26-dihydroxy cholecalciferols whose 
      single-crystal X-ray structure and 13C-NMR studies have been performed. It is
      suggested that these data may be helpful to clarify the stereospecificity of the 
      hydroxylation of the terminal methyl group of the cholesterol side chain in CTX.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450-linked monooxygenase 
      system: NADPH-hepatoredoxin reductase, hepatoredoxin, and cytochrome P-450s27 in 
      livers of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 255-63
AB  - We studied the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450-linked monooxygenase system in
      livers of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). The three
      components of this system, which catalyzes steroid 27-hydroxylation,
      NADPH-hepatoredoxin reductase, hepatoredoxin, and cytochrome P-450s27, were
      stained on a nitrocellulose sheet with antibodies against NADPH-adrenodoxin
      reductase, adrenodoxin, and cytochrome P-450scc, respectively, from bovine
      adrenocortical mitochondria. The concentrations of hepatoredoxin in the patients 
      were not significantly different from a control, but the level of
      NADPH-hepatoredoxin reductase was three times that of the control. Cytochrome
      P-450s27 was not detected in the patients, but it was present (22.8 pmol/mg of
      protein) in the control liver. This implies that a defect of mitochondrial
      cytochrome P-450s27 prevents steroid 27-hydroxylation of hepatic mitochondria in 
      patients with CTX.

      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1269-72
AB  - A patient is described with many clinical features of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX), but with only slightly elevated cholestanol/cholesterol
      concentration ratios in serum and xanthomatous tissue. However, with capillary
      gas chromatographic determinations of urinary bile acids and bile alcohols we
      demonstrated the typical biochemical abnormalities as seen in CTX patients. This 
      article emphasizes the value of urinary capillary gas chromatography as a
      specific test to establish the diagnosis of CTX and to monitor the biochemical
      effectivity of the different treatment regimens.

TI  - Identification of unconjugated bile acids in human bile.
PG  - 1154-62
AB  - Unconjugated bile acids in the bile of healthy and diseased humans were
      determined qualitatively and quantitatively by means of gas-liquid chromatography
      and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, after their isolation by
      ion-exchange chromatography. In a healthy person and three patients with
      cholelithiasis, unconjugated bile acids comprised 0.1-0.4% of total biliary bile 
      acids. The bile acid composition of the unconjugated fraction was quite different
      from that of the glycine- or taurine-conjugate fraction, in that it contained a
      relatively large proportion of unusual bile acids including C23 and C27 bile
      acids. In two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, C22 and C23 bile
      acids were the major constituents of the biliary unconjugated bile acids, and
      comprised about 0.8% of total bile acids; no detectable amounts of C27 bile acids
      were found in their bile. The analysis of biliary unconjugated bile acids may be 
      useful for the diagnosis of metabolic diseases concerning bile acids,
      particularly the accumulation or disappearance of unusual bile acids.

TI  - Increased (23R)-hydroxylase activity in patients suffering from cerebrotendinous 
      xanthomatosis, resulting in (23R)-hydroxylation of bile acids.
PG  - 585-92
AB  - Patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, an inborn error of
      metabolism in bile acid synthesis, excrete excessive amounts of 23-hydroxylated
      bile alcohols, 23-norcholic acid and 23-hydroxycholic acid into urine. In this
      study the configuration of this excreted 23-hydroxycholic acid was established as
      (23R)-hydroxycholic acid. Urine samples of two treated patients, receiving
      chenodeoxycholic acid, were investigated to see whether this administered bile
      acid was partly converted into 23-hydroxychenodeoxycholic acid. One patient was
      treated with ursodeoxycholic acid for 1 month and subsequently with
      chenodeoxycholic acid, and the urinary excretion of both
      (23R)-hydroxychenodeoxycholic acid and (23R)-hydroxyursodeoxycholic acid were
      followed. Indeed, all three patients excreted (23R)-hydroxylated chenodeoxycholic
      acid during oral treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, and the patient treated
      with ursodeoxycholic acid excreted (23R)-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholic acid.
      During treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid the excretion of
      (23R)-hydroxychenodeoxycholic acid increases at first and later on decreases
      markedly. These findings suggest increased (23R)-hydroxylase activity in patients
      suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, acting both on endogenously
      synthesized bile alcohols and on exogenously administered bile acids; during
      continuation of chenodeoxycholic acid treatment in an effective dose (750 mg/day)
      this enzyme activity gradually disappears.

TI  - Demonstration of 26-hydroxylation of C27-steroids in human skin fibroblasts, and 
      a deficiency of this activity in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 729-35
AB  - 26-Hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol and other 
      C27-steroids was demonstrated in cultured skin fibroblasts from healthy
      individuals. Activities in skin fibroblasts were approximately 5-10% of those
      previously found in human liver homogenates, and were inhibited by CO. The
      apparent Km was lowest for 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol
      (1.3 mumol/liter) and highest for 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol (12
      mumol/liter). The rate of 26-hydroxylation was highest with 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. These characteristics are similar to those of
      hepatic mitochondrial C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase. In skin fibroblasts from three 
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), 26-hydroxylation of
      C27-steroids proceeded at a rate of only 0.2-2.5% of healthy controls. No
      accumulation of endogenous 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol
      could be demonstrated in these cells, and the lowered formation of radioactive,
      26-hydroxylated products could not be explained by dilution of the labeled
      exogenous substrate. The present results add strong evidence to the concept that 
      the primary metabolic defect in CTX is a deficiency of C27-steroid
      26-hydroxylase.

TI  - Detection of carriers of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - Patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (an autosomal recessive
      inborn error of metabolism) can easily be distinguished from patients not
      suffering from this disease, as the first excrete large amounts of the bile
      alcohol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol, in urine,
      whereas the second do not. In order to find out, whether carriers of
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis can be detected in a biochemical way, we compared 
      known carriers with controls. The urinary excretions of 5 beta-cholestane-3
      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol of both groups were practically absent and no
      selection of carriers with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis could be made on that
      basis. When, however, carriers and non-carriers were subjected to cholestyramine 
      treatment, by which endogenous bile acid synthesis was stimulated, the urinary
      excretion of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol in the
      carrier rose considerably, whereas this excretion remained essentially the same
      in the non-carriers. This test can be of value in the genetic counseling of
      carriers with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and helpful in the detection of
      newborn patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

      conjugation by an ion-exchange chromatography. The predominant biliary bile acid 
      was cholic acid conjugated with glycine and taurine. Lesser amounts of the amino 
      acid conjugates of chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, 7-ketodeoxycholic
      acid, allocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid, and of unconjugated norcholic acid
      and allonorcholic acid were also present in the bile. The major fecal bile acid
      was 7-epicholic acid. Relatively large amounts of bile acids were excreted in the
      urine. Unconjugated 7-epicholic acid, norcholic acid, allonorcholic acid, and
      cholic acid predominated. The bile acid profiles of the patient were different
      from those of normal subjects and should be useful for the diagnosis.

TI  - Chronic demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 89-91
AB  - Three siblings with chemically proved cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presented
      with typical neurological manifestations of dementia and spinocerebellar
      disorder. Electrodiagnostic tests revealed demyelinating neuropathy in all three.
      Sural nerve biopsies showed loss of myelinated large fibers, marked Schwann cell 
      proliferation, and onion bulb formation. Teased-fiber preparations confirmed the 
      occurrence of segmental demyelination and remyelination. We suggest that
      demyelinating neuropathy is part of the neurological spectrum of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a
      recessively inherited motor and sensory neuropathy.

TI  - Biochemical diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis using reversed phase thin
      layer chromatography.
PG  - 771-5
AB  - We developed a simple quantitative procedure for cholestanol in serum involving
      reversed phase thin layer chromatography. This procedure was satisfactory with
      regard to the linearity of the calibration curve in the range of 100 ng to 1,000 
      ng, recovery and reproducibility. Only 100 microliter of serum was needed for
      determination of the cholestanol concentration. Prior to thin layer
      chromatography, cholesterol was converted to alpha- and beta-epoxides with
      m-chloroperbenzoic acid, which were clearly distinguishable from cholestanol on
      TLC. Detection of sterols was performed by spraying with phosphomolybdic acid
      solution. Quantification of cholestanol was carried out with a TLC scanning
      densitometer. When serum cholestanol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX)
      patients was quantified by TLC, GC-MS, and GC, the correlation among the three
      methods was found to be approximately 1:1:1. It was found that the present method
      was useful for the primary diagnostic screening of CTX because of its simplicity 
      and because many samples could be analyzed at one time.

AB  - Bile alcohols in bile, urine, and feces of a patient with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis have been analyzed by a combination of capillary gas-liquid
      chromatography and mass spectrometry after fractionation into groups according to
      mode of conjugation. The presence of at least 18 bile alcohols, which were
      excreted mainly as glucurono-conjugates in bile and urine, and as unconjugated
      forms in feces, was demonstrated. The following bile alcohols were identified
      with certainty by direct comparison with reference compounds: 5 beta-cholestane-3
      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol; (23R)-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,23-tetrol; 5 alpha- and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12

      alpha,25-tetrols; 27-nor-5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,25-pentol;

      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,25-pentols; 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,25,26-pentol. Although the bile alcohol profile in urine was quite
      different from those in bile and feces, the determination of urinary bile
      alcohols as well as of biliary and fecal bile alcohols could be used for
      diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

AB  - Large Achilles tendon xanthomas of the type found in severe familial
      hypercholesterolemia were the first manifestation of cholestanolosis
      (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) in our patient, an otherwise asymptomatic
      normolipidemic 21-year-old woman. Extensive laboratory investigation disclosed
      the presence of hyperapobetalipoproteinemia which did not resolve with the
      administration of probucol. Immunofluorescent studies revealed marked
      accumulation of apolipoprotein B in a xanthoma excised from the tricipital area. 
      This was in contrast to the spotty and weak fluorescence observed in a tuberous
      xanthoma, from the same anatomical area and histologically otherwise identical,
      obtained from a patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
      Hyperapobetalipoproteinemia has been reported before in association with
      sitosterolemia but not with cholestanolosis. We suggest that cholestanol, like
      sitosterol, may interfere with the normal uptake and degradation of low-density
      lipoproteins by peripheral cells.

TI  - On the mechanism of biosynthesis of cholestanol from 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol.
PG  - 41-6
AB  - In a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a small part of i.v.
      administered [7 beta-3H]-7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was converted into
      cholestanol. Traces of 3H were also found in plasma cholesterol, but its specific
      radioactivity was only about 1% of that of cholestanol. When [7 beta-3H]-7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol was given orally to rabbits, significant amounts of 3H
      were found in cholestanol in different organs. Much less 3H was found in
      cholesterol. Our results support the conclusion that the pathway from 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol to cholestanol does not involve cholesterol, but 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one as intermediates.

      dehydrogenase.
PG  - 1262-6
AB  - It was recently proposed that the increased biosynthesis of cholestanol in
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is due to increased activity of the delta
      5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase involved in bile acid biosynthesis, causing
      increased conversion of cholesterol into cholestanol through 4-cholesten-3-one.
      Our attempts to confirm this hypothesis have failed. Liver biopsy specimens from 
      two patients with CTX did not have any increased capacity to catalyze conversion 
      of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol into 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. Further, we
      did not find any changes in the activity of liver microsomal delta 5-3
      beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase after feeding rabbits with cholestanol or
      cholesterol. The findings are discussed in relation to our hypothesis that the
      accelerated biosynthesis of cholestanol in CTX is due to an increased conversion 
      of early bile acid intermediates into cholestanol.

PG  - 115-22
AB  - Patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, an inborn error of
      metabolism in bile acid synthesis, were given oral treatment with
      chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid and taurocholic acid.
      The effectiveness of the different therapies was evaluated by measuring the
      urinary excretion of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23,25-pentol,
      which should decrease, when the administered bile acid is able to suppress
      endogenous bile acid synthesis. From the results it is concluded that
      chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid activate the bile acid negative feedback
      mechanism, contrary to ursodeoxycholic acid and taurine conjugated cholic acid.
      Either cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid are the therapies of choice for the
      treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. For various reasons the use of
      cholic acid is especially recommended.

AB  - We performed a sural nerve biopsy in a patient with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) because of electrophysiologic evidence of peripheral
      neuropathy. The sections showed a striking loss of myelinated axons, the
      distribution of which suggested a compressive and/or ischemic process.
      Biochemical analysis disclosed large amounts of cholestanol, a cholesterol
      derivative that characteristically accumulates in CTX. However, the biochemical
      abnormality was not associated with any obvious structural alterations in the
      myelin lamellae or with abnormal storage material in Schwann's cells.

TI  - Biosynthesis of bile acids in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Relationship of
      bile acid pool sizes and synthesis rates to hydroxylations at C-12, C-25, and
      C-26.
PG  - 744-51
AB  - To examine the defect in side-chain oxidation during the formation of bile acids 
      in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, we measured in vitro hepatic microsomal
      hydroxylations at C-12 and C-25 and mitochondrial hydroxylation at C-26 and
      related them to the pool size and synthesis rates of cholic acid and
      chenodeoxycholic acid as determined by the isotope dilution technique. Hepatic
      microsomes and mitochondria were prepared from seven subjects with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and five controls. Primary bile acid synthesis was
      markedly reduced in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as follows: cholic acid, 133
      +/- 30 vs. 260 +/- 60 mg/d in controls; and chenodeoxycholic acid, 22 +/- 10 vs. 
      150 +/- 30 mg/d in controls. As postulated for chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis,
      mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol was
      present in all specimens and was 30-fold more active than the corresponding
      microsomal 25-hydroxylation. However, mean mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation of 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha-diol was less active in cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis than in controls: 59 +/- 17 compared with 126 +/- 21 pmol/mg
      protein per min. As for cholic acid synthesis, microsomal 25-hydroxylation of 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol was substantially higher in
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and control preparations (620 +/- 103 and 515 +/- 
      64 pmol/mg protein per min, respectively) than the corresponding control
      mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation of the same substrate (165 +/- 25 pmol/mg protein 
      per min). Moreover in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, mitochondrial 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol-26-hydroxylase activity was
      one-seventh as great as in controls. Hepatic microsomal 12 alpha-hydroxylation,
      which may be rate-controlling for the cholic acid pathway, was three times more
      active in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis than in controls: 1,600 vs. 500 pmol/mg 
      protein per min. These results demonstrate severely depressed primary bile acid
      synthesis in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with a reduction in chenodeoxycholic 
      acid formation and pool size disproportionately greater than that for cholic
      acid. The deficiency of chenodeoxycholic acid can be accounted for by hyperactive
      microsomal 12 alpha-hydroxylation that diverts precursors into the cholic acid
      pathway combined with decreased side-chain oxidation (mitochondrial
      26-hydroxylation). However, side-chain oxidation in cholic acid biosynthesis may 
      be initiated via microsomal 25-hydroxylation of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol was substantially lower in control
      and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis liver. Thus, separate mechanisms may exist for
      the cleavage of the cholesterol side chain in cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic
      acid biosynthesis.

TI  - Effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on biliary and urinary bile acids and bile
      alcohols in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; monitoring by high performance liquid
      chromatography.
PG  - 690-8
AB  - Biliary and urinary bile alcohol and bile acid composition has been determined by
      high performance liquid chromatography in patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis before and after treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid. Most of the 
      bile acids and bile alcohols in the bile and urine were separated in less than 30
      min using a radial pack C18 muBondapak 5 micron particle size column with a
      mobile phase of acetonitrile-water-methanol-acetic acid 70:70:20:1 (v/v/v/v) at a
      flow rate of 2 ml/min, and a refractive index detector. Before treatment, cholic 
      acid (49%) and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-tetrol (27%) were
      the major biliary bile acid and bile alcohol, respectively, but were not detected
      in the urine of five patients. 5 beta-Cholestane-pentols were, instead, the major
      urinary bile alcohols with 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23 xi,
      25-pentol (56%) predominating. Whereas 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12
      alpha, 24S,25-pentol was not detected in the bile, it was isolated in the urine
      of all patients (27%). The only urinary bile acid isolated by high performance
      liquid chromatography was nor-cholic acid. After 1 month of treatment with
      chenodeoxycholic acid, 0.75 g/day, chenodeoxycholic acid became the major bile
      acid in the bile of all patients (71%) along with its metabolite, ursodeoxycholic
      acid (21%). Cholic acid and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha,
      25-tetrol were drastically reduced and were only 3% each. The excretion of 5
      beta-cholestane-pentols in the urine was also drastically reduced from 130 mg/day
      to 15 mg/day.

TI  - A novel pathway for biosynthesis of cholestanol with 7 alpha-hydroxylated
      C27-steroids as intermediates, and its importance for the accumulation of
      cholestanol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 448-55
AB  - A mixture of 7 alpha-3H- and 4-14C-labeled cholesterol was administered
      intravenously to rats. Cholestanol with 20-30% lower ratio between 3H and 14C
      than in cholesterol could be isolated from different organs. In a healthy human
      control, cholestanol isolated from feces had a 3H/14C ratio which was 28% lower
      than in administered cholesterol. Cholesterol and coprostanol reisolated in these
      experiments had the same ratio between 3H and 14C as in the precursor. A
      previously unknown pathway for formation of cholestanol, involving 7
      alpha-hydroxylated intermediates, may explain these results. Under normal
      conditions, this pathway is responsible for at most 30% of the cholestanol
      synthesized from cholesterol. Intravenous administration of the 7 alpha-3H- and
      4-14C-labeled cholesterol to a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) 
      resulted in formation of cholestanol which had 70-75% lower 3H/14C ratio. It is
      concluded that the novel pathway involving 7 alpha-hydroxylated intermediates is 
      accelerated in patients with CTX. This acceleration may contribute essentially to
      the accumulation of cholestanol, which is a predominant feature of this disease. 
      7 alpha-Hydroxycholesterol and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one might be
      intermediates in the novel pathway to cholestanol. After intravenous
      administration of 7 beta-3H-labeled 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in a patient with 
      CTX, significant amounts of 3H were incorporated into plasma and fecal
      cholestanol. Only small amounts of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one are excreted into the intestine, and we therefore
      conclude that the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation step mainly occurs in the liver. In
      CTX, the synthesis of cholestanol may be accelerated because the concentrations
      of 7 alpha-hydroxylated bile acid intermediates in the liver are increased. A
      possible mechanism for the conversion of a minor fraction of 7
      alpha-hydroxycholesterol into cholestanol is suggested.

TI  - A novel route for the biosynthesis of cholestanol, and its significance for the
      pathogenesis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 15-21
AB  - The main symptoms in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) are caused by increased
      synthesis of cholestanol (5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol) and depositions of this
      steroid in brain and xanthomas. Previously, we have shown a deficiency in CTX of 
      the mitochondrial C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase essential for normal degradation of 
      the cholesterol side chain. Because of this defect, different 7
      alpha-hydroxylated substrates for the 26-hydroxylase accumulate in the liver -
      among these 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. The possibility that such
      accumulated 7 alpha-hydroxylated bile acid precursors can be converted into
      cholestanol was studied by administration of labelled 7 alpha-hydroxy-cholesterol
      to bile fistula rats and to a patient with CTX. Label was incorporated into
      cholestanol in the rats as well as in the CTX-patient. The quantitative
      significance of this 7 alpha-hydroxylation/dehydroxylation route for the
      biosynthesis of cholestanol was examined by administering a mixture of 7 alpha-3H
      and 4-14C-labeled cholesterol to rats, rabbits and a human volunteer. In all
      species, about 25% of 3H was lost during the conversion of cholesterol to
      cholestanol. In a patient with CTX, the flow through the 7
      alpha-hydroxylation/dehydroxylation route was greatly increased, since 75% of 3H 
      present in the precursor (cholesterol) had been removed in cholestanol isolated
      from bile, serum and faeces. Experiments with germfree rats and bile fistula rats
      indicate that the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation mainly occurs in the liver. The
      microsomal fraction of rat liver was found to 7 alpha-dehydroxylate 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one at a slow rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Long-term treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with chenodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 1649-52
AB  - We studied the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid in 17 patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Before treatment, all subjects were symptomatic, 
      with Achilles tendon xanthomas (in 15 of 17), cataracts (in 12 of 17), dementia
      (in 13 of 17), pyramidal-tract signs (in all 17), cerebellar dysfunction (in 13
      of 17), mild peripheral neuropathy (in 7 of 17), electroencephalographic
      abnormalities (in 10 of 13), and abnormal cerebral computerized axial tomographic
      scans (in 10 of 12). After at least one year of chenodeoxycholic acid treatment
      (750 mg per day), dementia cleared in 10 subjects, and pyramidal and cerebellar
      signs disappeared in 5 and improved in another 8. Peripheral neuropathy was no
      longer detected in six. The electroencephalogram became normal in five and showed
      fewer abnormalities in another three subjects. Cerebral computerized axial
      tomographic scans improved in seven patients; the changes included the
      disappearance of a cerebellar xanthoma in one case. Concomitantly, mean plasma
      cholestanol levels declined threefold, and abnormal bile acid synthesis was
      suppressed. We conclude that long-term therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid may
      correct the biochemical abnormalities and arrest and possibly reverse the
      progression of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

TI  - Comparative effects of cholestanol and cholesterol on hepatic sterol and bile
      acid metabolism in the rat.
PG  - 1773-81
AB  - Large amounts of cholestanol, the 5 alpha-dihydro derivative of cholesterol are
      found in tissues of patients with the rare inherited sterol storage disease
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Although small amounts of cholestanol are present
      in virtually every tissue of normal man, little is known about its metabolism and
      effect on cholesterol and bile acid formation. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the absorption and metabolism of cholestanol and its early effects on
      hepatic morphology and on the rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol and bile acid 
      biosynthesis. After 2 wk on a diet supplemented with 2% cholestanol, total liver 
      sterol content increased by 48% (3.26 vs. 2.20 mg/g), and resulted in a
      significant rise in hepatic cholestanol concentration to 1.4 mg/g. However,
      cholestanol was less efficiently absorbed from the intestine than cholesterol and
      interfered with cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, hepatic
      hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity rose 2.6-fold (from
      150.3 to 397.0 pmol/mg per min) during cholestanol feeding, and was associated
      with a marked proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the
      centrilobular areas. In addition, significant amounts of allocholic acid (16%)
      and allochenodeoxycholic acid (5%) were formed from cholestanol and excreted in
      the bile. These results show that cholestanol is absorbed from the intestine,
      interferes with cholesterol absorption, and is deposited in the liver. However,
      in contrast to cholesterol, cholestanol feeding was associated with a marked
      elevation of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Thus, despite structural similarity
      between cholesterol and its 5 alpha-saturated derivative, cholestanol does not
      exert feedback inhibition on hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis.

TI  - Capillary gas chromatographic determinations of urinary bile acids and bile
      alcohols in CTX patients proving the ineffectivity of ursodeoxycholic acid
      treatment.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - Urine samples and serum samples of a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis 
      (CTX) were investigated by means of capillary gas chromatography, both before and
      during oral treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and the results compared 
      with those obtained during chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) therapy. The
      predominantly excreted bile alcohol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,23,25-pentol and two abnormal bile acids, i.e. 23-norcholic acid and
      23-hydroxycholic acid were determined. In addition, the serum
      cholestanol/cholesterol ratio was determined. Whereas previous experiments
      demonstrated that the urinary excretion of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,23,25-pentol and the abnormal bile acids decreased within a few weeks
      during CDCA therapy, the present study shows that their urinary excretions remain
      essentially the same during UDCA treatment. In contrast to the decrease in the
      serum cholestanol/cholesterol ratio during CDCA therapy, this ratio remains
      essentially the same during UDCA therapy. It is therefore concluded that, in
      contrast to CDCA therapy, UDCA treatment is not effective in the treatment of
      CTX.

TI  - Transformation of 4-cholesten-3-one and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one into
      cholestanol and bile acids in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 276-83
AB  - In order to determine whether cholestanol and bile acids are derived from the
      same precursor, key intermediates of both biosynthetic pathways beyond
      cholesterol were administered intravenously to a patient with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis and to a control subject. After pulse-labeling with
      [4-14C]4-cholesten-3-one and [G-3H]7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one,
      cholestanol, cholesterol, and the two primary bile acids, cholic acid and
      chenodeoxycholic acid were isolated from specimens of bile. Each compound was
      purified by thin-layer chromatography and conclusively identified by gas-liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. In other studies, the in vitro formation of
      4-cholesten-3-one from cholesterol was measured in hepatic microsomal fractions
      prepared from a subject with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and from 3 control
      individuals. In all subjects, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were labeled 
      with tritium, but neither cholesterol nor cholestanol contained this isotope. In 
      contrast, 14C was detected in the cholestanol fraction with trace amounts in
      chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and cholesterol. Hepatic microsomes prepared 
      from liver biopsy specimens obtained from a subject with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis produced three times more 4-cholesten-3-one than the controls. The 
      results indicate that 4-cholesten-3-one was converted primarily into cholestanol 
      and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one into cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid.
      Neither ketonic steroid was transformed into cholesterol. The increased
      production of cholestanol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis may be accounted for 
      by enhanced hepatic formation of 4-cholesten-3-one. 7
      alpha-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one is a precursor of bile acids, but not of
      cholestanol.

PG  - 305-15
AB  - The concentration ratios of cholestanol/cholesterol in biological materials
      (serum, cerebrospinal fluid and tendon biopsy) were determined using a capillary 
      gas chromatographic method. The method was validated by gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. The ratio was determined in several groups of patients: (a)
      patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and
      tendon biopsy), before and during chenodeoxycholic acid therapy, (b) patients
      receiving cholestyramine therapy (in serum), (c) patients suffering from various 
      liver diseases (in serum) and (d) one patient before and after liver
      transplantation (in serum). It can be concluded that the cholestanol/cholesterol 
      concentration ratio is a potentially useful parameter for monitoring liver
      diseases but is not specific for establishing the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.

      nerve, soleus muscle, and achilles tendon. We also performed neurophysiologic
      investigations. Another patient died, and a postmortem examination of both brain 
      and spinal cord was made. It was concluded that both the central and the
      peripheral nervous system were involved in CTX, but the peripheral system only to
      a slight degree, and that the pathology was predominantly neuroaxonal rather than
      demyelinating in character.

TI  - Isolation of 5 alpha-cholestane-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol from bile of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Inefficiency of this steroid as a precursor to
      cholestanol.
PG  - 220-6
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare, inherited disease characterized by
      defective bile acid biosynthesis as well as by accumulation of cholesterol and
      cholestanol. The mechanism behind the accumulation of cholestanol is unknown.
      Using combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 5 alpha-cholestane-3 beta, 7
      alpha-diol could be identified as a minor component in bile from two such
      patients. There were no significant amounts of this steroid in bile from control 
      subjects. Most probably, the 5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol found is
      formed from 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in the liver. 7
      alpha-Hydroxy-1-cholesten-3-one, being a normal intermediate in bile acid
      biosynthesis, is known to accumulate in the liver and bile of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, due to a defect of the mitochondrial
      26-hydroxylase. The possibility was tested that (7 beta-3H)-labeled 5
      alpha-cholestane-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol could be converted into cholestanol by a
      direct 7 alpha-dehydroxylation in the intestine. This conversion did not occur in
      rabbits, however, regardless of whether the labelled steroid was administered
      orally or intracoecally. It is concluded that 5 alpha-cholestane-3 beta, 7
      alpha-diol is of little or no importance as a precursor to cholestanol in
      rabbits. Most probably, this is also the case in patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.

TI  - Depression in a patient with dementia secondary to cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 568-71
AB  - The occurrence of depression in a patient with pre-existing dementia, associated 
      with a rare neurological disorder, is described. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
      is a genetically transmitted disease that is associated with deposition of
      cholestanol in the central nervous system and Achilles tendons. A focus on the
      often unusual presentation of combined major depression and dementia is offered
      as well as the interaction of genetic disorders and psychiatric symptoms. The
      diagnostic and treatment approach to these patients is discussed in regard to
      this reported case. Also, there is a review of the importance of recognition of
      early signs and symptoms of both depression in demented patients and evidences of
      presenile dementia because the prospects of treatability and reversibility should
      be a prime consideration for these disorders. This case report illustrates the
      potential for effectiveness of psychiatric interventions for patients with
      neurological and genetic disorders.

TI  - Lipid storage disease: Part I. Ultrastructure of xanthoma cells in various
      xanthomatous diseases.
PG  - 959-77
AB  - The fundamental ultrastructure of lipid storage in the xanthoma cells of various 
      xanthomatous diseases, including familial hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa, III, and
      V, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Wolman's disease, Tangier disease,
      Hand-Schuller-Christian disease, and normolipidemic cutaneous xanthomatosis,
      revealed lipid vacuoles, either membrane-bound or with no single unit membrane,
      cholesterol crystals, multivesicular or multilocular lipid bodies, myelin-like
      bodies, and ceroid granules (residual bodies). According to the presence or
      absence of such a single unit membrane and enzyme cytochemical demonstration of
      acid phosphatase activity, these lipid storage inclusions were largely classified
      into lysosomal and non-lysosomal ones; the former included membrane-bound lipid
      vacuoles, cholesterol crystals, multivesicular or multilocular lipid bodies,
      myelin-like bodies, and ceroid granules and the latter was lipid vacuoles with no
      limiting membrane. The ultrastructural relationship on formation of these
      lysosomal and non-lysosomal lipid storage inclusions and pathogenesis of the
      lipid storage in the xanthoma cells of the disorders were presented. As for the
      origin of the xanthoma cells, the majority of them were considered to be derived 
      from macrophages in many of the disease; however, transformation of fibroblasts
      into xanthoma cells was confirmed in xanthomatous diseases, such as
      Hand-Schuller-Christian disease.

TI  - Diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and effect of chenodeoxycholic 
      acid therapy by analysis of urine using capillary gas chromatography.
PG  - 53-65
AB  - By means of capillary gas chromatography urine samples of patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were investigated before and during
      treatment by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid. The occurrence of
      various conjugated bile alcohols, presumably glucuronides, was demonstrated, the 
      major compound being 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23 xi,
      25-pentol. In the bile acid fraction norcholic acid and hydroxycholic acid were
      shown to be present in considerable amounts. In this way the presence of CTX can 
      be demonstrated conclusively. After chenodeoxycholic acid therapy the excretion
      of both abnormal bile acids as well as of bile alcohols rapidly decreased within 
      a few weeks, showing the effectiveness of the treatment. By early discovery and
      subsequent therapy it may be possible to prevent the onset of the detrimental
      symptoms such as mental deficiency, caused by the accumulation of cholestanol and
      cholesterol in CTX patients.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: clinical and laboratory study of 2 cases.
PG  - 305-11
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an unusual disease, clinically characterized by
      dementia, cataracts, progressive cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and multiple
      xanthomas of tendons and other tissues. It was first described in 1937, and in
      1968 the storage of cholesterol and cholestanol in the tissues was demonstrated. 
      About 30 cases have been reported. The authors of the present communication
      report 2 cases in siblings with parental consanguinity. They showed mental
      impairment and cataract, and multiple xanthomas; in 1 case, pyramidal signs were 
      detected in the 4 limbs associated with a rise of the vibration sense thresholds 
      in the feet. The diagnosis was confirmed in both cases by greatly increased
      cholestanol levels in the blood serum, bile and in a tendon xanthoma. Cholesterol
      concentrations in the blood serum and bile were normal although increased in the 
      xanthoma. One case had a gallstone. Computerized tomography showed hyperdense
      nodules in the cerebellar hemispheres of one patient, and a calcified parietal
      nodule in his sister. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is discussed. Treatment
      with ursodeoxycholic acid is in course in both patients.

PG  - 233-7
AB  - A large family with three children affected with the autosomal recessive disease 
      of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) was studied for class I (HLA-A,B,C) and
      class II antigens (HLA-DR,D,SB), properdin factor B and glyoxalase. The extensive
      typing revealed an informative cross-over between HLA-B and Bf, indicating that
      Bf is located centromeric to the HLA-B locus and segregated in this family with
      HLA-D/DR. The parents in this family were first cousins and their parents were
      also first cousins. Three of their four haplotypes share B14, BfS, DR1, Dx and
      SB4 and may be identical by descent. The three affected children carried among
      them all four parental haplotypes, indicating that close linkage of the CTX locus
      to HLA is unlikely.

TI  - Role of the 26-hydroxylase in the biosynthesis of bile acids in the normal state 
      and in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. An in vivo study.
PG  - 142-8
AB  - On the basis of different in vitro studies, we have previously suggested that the
      basic metabolic defect in the rare inherited disease cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lack of a hepatic mitochondrial C27-steroid
      26-hydroxylase, involved in the normal biosynthesis of bile acids (1980. J. Clin.
      Invest. 65: 1418-1430; 1981. J. Lipid Res. 22: 191-200; 22: 632-640). In the
      present work, this hypothesis was tested in vivo. One patient with CTX and two
      control subjects received intravenously a mixture of [4-14C]7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and [6 beta-3H]7
      alpha,26-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, steroids believed to be important
      precursors of chenodeoxycholic acid. The ratio between 14C and 3H in cholic acid 
      and chenodeoxycholic acid isolated from bile of the CTX-patient was approximately
      1/40 and 1/60 of those of the control subjects, respectively. Another patient
      with CTX and one control subject received a mixture of [4-14C]5 beta-cholestane-3
      alpha,7 alpha-diol and [1,2-3H]5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,26-triol, both
      possible precursors to chenodeoxycholic acid. In this case the 14C/3H ratio in
      cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid from the patient with CTX was 1/10 and
      1/15, respectively, compared with that of the control subject. The most likely
      explanation for these findings is that very little of the 14C-precursors, i.e.
      without a 26-hydroxyl group, can be converted into cholic acid and
      chenodeoxycholic acid because of a defect of the 26-hydroxylase step. The results
      obtained are in accord with our previous findings in vitro. The results further
      underline the importance of the 26-hydroxylase pathway in the normal biosynthesis
      of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in man.

TI  - Biosynthesis of cholestanol from intestinal 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one.
PG  - 8363-7
AB  - Using isotope dilution-mass spectrometry, it was shown that human bile contains
      significant amount of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, an intermediate in the
      major pathway for bile acid biosynthesis. In bile from 14 healthy subjects, the
      concentration was 0.14 +/- 0.01 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.). Four bile samples 
      collected from two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis contained
      considerably higher amounts of this steroid, 0.47-1.32 micrograms/ml. After oral 
      administration of [4-14C]7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to rabbits,
      14C-labeled cholestanol could be isolated from the intestinal wall, liver, and
      blood after 24 h. The label incorporated into the intestinal wall was about 10%
      of that obtained with [4-14C]cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one or [4-14C]4-cholesten-3-one 
      as precursors. Labeled cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one and 4-cholesten-3-one could be
      isolated from the intestinal contents 12 h after feeding [4-14C]7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to rabbits. It is proposed that
      cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one and 4-cholesten-3-one are formed from 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one by the same mechanism as that involved in 7
      alpha-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids. We suggest that biliary 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one may be a physiological precursor to cholestanol. 
      The possibility is discussed that part of the increased formation of cholestanol 
      in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is due to excess biliary 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one or some metabolite of this steroid.

TI  - A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effects of ursodeoxycholic acid
      administration on serum bile acids and cholestanol.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare familiar disease characterized by 
      tendon xanthomas, cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, dementia and an elevated serum
      cholestanol level. In this paper, a 50-year-old man with typical signs and
      symptoms of CTX is described. Serum cholestanol and chelesterol concentrations
      were 17.9-28.6 micrograms/ml and 109-153 mg/dl, respectively. The determination
      of non-sulfated bile acid concentration in the serum assayed by mass
      fragmentography disclosed an abnormal profile. The concentration of cholic acid
      (0.30-0.52 microgram/ml) was higher than normal, while those of chenodeoxycholic 
      acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid were extremely 
      low or undetectable. Administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg per day,
      orally) for 2 weeks resulted in a marked reduction of serum cholic acid
      concentration. However, serum cholestanol levels remained unchanged.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: reduced serum 26-hydroxycholesterol.
PG  - 627-30
AB  - Serum 26-hydroxycholesterol was quantitated by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry
      in normal individuals and in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In the
      normal individuals, the concentration of 26-hydroxycholesterol in serum ranged
      from 4.3 to 13.0 microgram/100 ml. In five patients with CTX,
      26-hydroxycholesterol in serum ranged from 0 to 0.6 microgram/100 ml. The
      findings can be explained by reduced or absent mitochondrial C27 steroid
      26-hydroxylase activity. The method is useful for detection of CTX and perhaps
      other disturbances of sterol and bite acid metabolism.

TI  - Biosynthesis of cholesterol, lanosterol, and delta 7-cholestenol, but not
      cholestanol, in cultured fibroblasts from normal individuals and patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 597-603
AB  - The cholesterol and cholestanol biosynthetic pathways and the control of
      cholesterolgenesis were investigated in skin fibroblasts, from patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and from normal subjects, growth in a
      lipoprotein deficient (d less than 1.25 g/ml) medium. [3H]Acetate was added to
      the culture medium and its incorporation into sterols was assayed by both
      argentation and reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The labeling
      patterns were similar in both CTX and control cells with 3H being found, in order
      of increasing activity, in lanosterol, delta 7-cholestenol, and cholesterol. No
      3H-labeled material at all, however, could be detected in the TLC mobility region
      corresponding to cholestanol. The ratio of cholestanol to cholesterol in the low 
      density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction from the plasma of individuals with CTX
      ranged from 1.4 to 5.3%, which is equal to or slightly greater than the ratio in 
      whole plasma. Approximately 65-70% of the total plasma and LDL cholestanol and
      cholesterol were esterified. Since CTX-LDL, added to incubates of normal cells
      and normal LDL added to CTX fibroblasts suppressed HMG-CoA reductase activity and
      stimulated cholesterol esterification equally, and since 125-I-labeled control
      LDL was degraded with normal kinetics from the surface of CTX fibroblasts, both
      CTX-LDL and CTX fibroblasts LDL membrane receptors appear to be biologically
      normal. These results suggest that 1) cholesterol is synthesized in cultured CTX 
      and control fibroblasts via delta 7-cholestenol, a C-24,25 saturated
      intermediate; 2) cholestanol is not synthesized in the skin of CTX patients but
      is transported there from the liver via the plasma LDL; and 3) CTX is not a
      disease associated with a defect of peripheral tissue LDL receptors.

AB  - Patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis may present with adolescent-onset
      cataracts and tendon xanthomas, and can have progressive neurological,
      myocardial, pulmonary, and endocrine dysfunction leading to death. The disease is
      inherited as an autosomal recessive and results in increasing deposition of
      cholesterol and cholestanol in vital organ systems; the primary biochemical
      abnormality is a block in bile acid synthesis which is manifested by a diminished
      pool of chenodeoxycholic acid. Replacement therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid may
      reduce cholesterol and cholestanol production.

AB  - Non-sulfated bile acid concentrations in sera of 10 cases of cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) were determined by mass fragmentography. Total bile acid
      (TBA) in serum was 0.492 +/- 0.436 microgram/ml (mean +/- SD) which was
      significantly lower than that (1.481 +/- 0.571) in healthy control sera. Cholic
      acid was 0.342 +/- 0.291 microgram/ml and was the dominant bile acid, which
      constituted 69.5% of TBA in serum. Chenodeoxycholic acid was 0.111 +/- 0.133
      microgram/ml being a minor component in CTX sera, although it was the major bile 
      acid in healthy control sera. Other bile acids such as deoxycholic acid,
      lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid were scarcely detected. Subnormal TBA
      level and deranged bile acid composition in CTX sera may reflect the defect of
      bile acid biosynthesis in CTX patients. Determination of serum bile acid may be
      useful in the diagnosis of CTX.

TI  - Abnormal high density lipoproteins in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1295-304
AB  - The plasma lipoprotein profiles and high density lipoproteins (HDL) were
      characterized in patients with the genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
      (CTX). Abnormalities in the HDL may contribute to their increased atherogenesis
      and excessive deposits of tissue sterols in the presence of low or low-normal
      concentrations of plasma cholesterol (165 +/- 25 mg/dl) and low density
      lipoproteins (LDL). The mean HDL-cholesterol concentration in the CTX plasmas was
      14.5 +/- 3.2 mg/dl, about one-third the normal value. The low HDL-cholesterol
      reflects a low concentration and an abnormal lipid composition of the plasma HDL.
      Relative to normal HDL, the cholesteryl esters are low, free cholesterol and
      phospholipids essentially normal, and triglycerides increased. The ratio of
      apoprotein (apo) to total cholesterol in the HDL of CTX was two to three times
      greater than normal. In the CTX HDL, the ratio of apoAI to apoAII was high, the
      proportion of apoC low, and a normally minor form of apoAI increased relative to 
      other forms. The HDL in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and 
      in particle size. The abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and
      composition of the plasma HDL result from metabolic defects that are not
      understood but may be linked to the genetic defect in bile acid synthesis in CTX.
      As a consequence, it is probable that the normal functions of the HDL, possibly
      including modulation of LDL-cholesterol uptake and the removal of excess
      cholesterol from peripheral tissues, are perturbed significantly in this disease.

PG  - 1463-5
AB  - In nine patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), computed tomography
      (CT) demonstrated diffuse white matter hypodensity above and below the tentorium.
      This was attributed to sterol infiltration with secondary demyelination. In one
      patient, a focal right cerebellar hypodense lesion reflected a true xanthoma.
      These findings suggest that the neurologic symptoms, no matter how longstanding, 
      result from metabolic encephalopathy rather than irreversible destruction of
      brain tissue by xanthomas.

AB  - Tendon and skin xanthomas have been found in association with familial
      hypercholesterolemia, broad beta disease, beta sitosterolemia, and
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We are reporting a patient with tendon and
      tuberous xanthomas accompanied by normal plasma lipids. In addition, the plasma
      and xanthoma concentration of cholestanol was normal, while beta sitosterol was
      absent. These data rule out the disorders listed and suggest that this patient's 
      disorder may represent a new normolipemic xanthomatosis.

      xanthomatosis was diagnosed on the basis of increased cholestanol levels in his
      plasma, red cells and xanthoma, changes in bile acid composition due to the
      defective synthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid. Coexisting beta-sitosterolemia was 
      confirmed by the finding of large amounts of the plant sterols such as
      beta-sitosterol and campesterol. This is the first report of these two rare lipid
      storage disorders in the same patient.

TI  - Simplified determination of cholestanol in serum by gas-liquid chromatography:
      biochemical diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - Cholestanol (5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol) in human serum was determined by
      gas-liquid chromatography after removal by epoxidation of cholesterol which is
      present in amounts about 400 times those of cholestanol and disturbs the accurate
      determination of minor sterols in serum. Epicholestanol (5 alpha-cholestan-3
      alpha-ol) was used as an internal standard. By this method the cholestanol
      content in sera of 7 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was determined.
      The cholestanol levels in those sera were significantly higher than those of
      normal subjects and the present method proved to be useful in a biochemical
      diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: defective liver mitochondrial hydroxylation of
      chenodeoxycholic acid precursors.
PG  - 632-40
AB  - Oxidation of the side chain of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol, 7
      alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol has been
      studied in subcellular fractions of liver from a patient with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) and a control subject. All intermediates were efficiently
      26-hydroxylated and further converted to the corresponding 26-carboxylated
      derivatives by the mitochondrial fraction of normal human liver. No such
      conversion was observed with the mitochondria from the liver of the CTX patient
      and the control subject. 12 alpha-Hydroxylation of the patient and the control
      subject. 12 alpha-Hydroxylation of the substrates was very efficient with the
      microsomal fractions from both subjects. Bases on these and previous findings
      (Oftebro, H., I. Bjorkhem, S. Skrede, A. Schreiner, and J. I. Pedersen. 1980. J. 
      Clin. Invest. 65: 1481-1430), it i concluded that the metabolic defect in CTX is 
      a complete lack of mitochondrial C27-steroid 26-hydroxylase. In CTX the
      precursors of chenodeoxycholic acid are first attacked by the microsomal 12
      alpha-hydroxylase and subsequently by the microsomal 25-hydroxylase as an
      alternate route to cholic acid formation. This explains the increased ratio of
      cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid observed in the bile of these patients. In
      the normal liver the formation of both cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid
      involves a mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation.

      fractions of liver. After purification by high performance liquid chromatography 
      and conversion into trimethylsilyl ethers, the amounts of different endogenous
      unlabeled steroids were determined by selected ion monitoring. In normal liver,
      the concentration of 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol (about 0.1-0.2
      microgram/ml protein) was higher than the concentration of the other steroids
      (about 0.01-0.05 microgram/mg protein). The concentration of the different
      steroids was highest in the microsomal fraction of the liver homogenate. In a
      liver sample from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), the
      amounts of the 12 alpha-hydroxylated steroids were considerably higher than in
      the normal liver. The levels of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha-diol were similar or only slightly higher than
      in the liver of the control patients. The concentration of 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7
      alpha-diol was very high in the mitochondrial fraction of the CTX-liver. The
      findings are in accordance with the previous demonstration that the basic
      metabolic defect in CTX is a lack of the mitochondrial 26-hydroxylase. The
      results are further compatible with the contention that 7
      alpha,26-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one is an important intermediate in the normal
      bile acid biosynthesis.

      with high gene frequency in Sephardim of Moroccan origin.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - We described 6 patients (from 3 families) affected with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX). All are Sephardic Jews of Moroccan extraction. In view of
      the small number of CTX patients diagnosed in the world (a total of 50 including 
      our 6 patients), we are probably dealing with an ethnic subgroup with a high CTX 
      gene frequency, which we have estimated to be 1/108. Since there are differences 
      in expression in this disease, we recommend cholestanol study in cases of
      undiagnosed cataract or tendinous xanthomas in childhood or early adolescence.
      The diagnosis in CTX is important not only for genetic counseling, but also in
      veiw of possible treatment.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare inherited lipid storage disease.
      The primary biochemical defect in CTX is a block in hepatic bile acid synthesis
      with consequent accumulation of two bile pentols in the liver. Hence specimens of
      liver from four affecteds were examined by light and electron microscopy. These
      revealed perisinusoidal fibrosis, bile canalicular alterations and hepatocellular
      alterations including the appearance of fat droplets, proliferation of the smooth
      endoplasmic reticulum, accumulation of lipofuscin-like pigment, foci of
      cytoplasmic degeneration, proliferation of microbodies and prominent
      mitochondrial changes. In one untreated patient crystalloid cores were noted in
      the microbodies. These disappeared on therapy.

TI  - Occurrence of bile alcohol glucuronides in bile of patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 1015-21
AB  - Using thin-layer chromatography, bile alcohol glucuronides were found with
      taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids in the bile of four patients with
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The concentration of the bile alcohol
      glucuronides was 1.7-5.2 times higher than that of the conjugated bile acids.
      Detectable amounts of unconjugated bile alcohols were not found in the bile of
      these patients. The bile alcohol glucuronides were isolated from the bile of one 
      of the patients by means of preparative thin-layer chromatography. Treatment with
      beta-glucuronidase of the bile alcohol glucuronides liberated glucuronic acid and
      a mixture of bile alcohols. More than 90% of the liberated bile alcohols was 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 25-tetrol, and lesser amounts of 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,
      7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24-tetrol, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23,
      25-pentol, and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,-7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24 alpha, 25-pentol 
      were also obtained. The bile alcohol glucuronides were not oxidized by the
      treatment with 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, indicating that the
      glucuronide moiety was at 3 alpha-hydroxyl position of the bile alcohols.
      Comparison of the mass spectra of the acetylated and methylated derivatives of
      the natural glucuronides and the synthetic 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25-triacetoxy-5
      beta-cholestan-3 alpha-O-(methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronate)
      also indicated that the bile alcohol glucuronides consisted of mainly 5 beta -
      cholestane - 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 25 - tetrol - glucuronide.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a defect in mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation
      required for normal biosynthesis of cholic acid.
PG  - 1418-30
AB  - Oxidation of side chain of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol was
      studied in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and in control
      subjects, using various subcellular fractions of liver homogenate and a method
      based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry. In the control, 5 beta-cholestane-3 
      alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol was converted into 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7
      alpha,12 alpha,26-tetrol and 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5
      beta-cholestanoic acid by the mitochondrial fraction, and into 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,-25-tetrol by the microsomal fraction.
      In the CTX patient, liver mitochondria were completely devoid of 26-hydroxylase
      activity. The same mitochondrial fraction catalyzed 25-hydroxylation of vitamin
      D3. The microsomal fraction of liver of the subject with CTX contained more than 
      50-fold the normal amount of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol.
      The basic metabolid defect in CTX appears to be a lack of the mitochondrial
      26-hydroxylase. The excretion in the bile of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha,25-tetrol and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24 alpha,25-pentol
      observed in CTX patients may be secondary to the accumulation of the major
      substrate for the 26-hydroxylase, i. e., 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12
      alpha-triol, and exposure of this substrate to the normally less active
      microsomal 25-and 24-hydroxylases. It is concluded that the major pathway in the 
      biosynthesis of cholic acid in human liver involves a mitochondrial C27-steroid
      26-hydroxylation.

      involving a homogeneous medium is described. This involves treating the

      triethylamine. Grignard reaction of the resulting triformyloxy methyl homocholate
      yielded 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,25-tetrol. Large amounts of
      this bile alcohol were needed to further investigate the defect of cholic acid
      biosynthesis in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).

TI  - A new unified theory: C-C-2W is the chemical cause of all so-called cholesterol
      and cholestanol lipidoses.
PG  - 153-65
AB  - The water-insoluble cholesterol-cholestanol-water adduct C-C-2W, chemical and
      physical cause of atherosclerosis and gallstones, has now been found in tendinous
      xanthoma as well; C-C-2W, and not cholestanol, is the initial compound deposited 
      in hereditary CTX (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis). From these and other findings
      it is theorized that what have been termed cholesterol or cholestanol lipidoses
      should instead be characterized as C-C-2W lipidoses. More than 1 mg of
      cholestanol . H2O present in the body causes crystallizaion of C-C-2W . This
      happens when the steroid meets cholesterol . H2O in sufficient concentration to
      reach a solubility product of 10(-7) mg/ml. In this light the literature can be
      interpreted to indicate that C-C-2W exerts negative effects on liver, intima
      tissue, eyes, lungs, and other parts of the body. Those effects include
      inflammation, cell necrosis, destruction of cell membranes, abnormal growth and, 
      perhaps, neoplastic activity. Up to 200 g of C-C-2W in the body may be tolerated 
      if evenly spread but not if localized in one or two areas only; e.g., the brain
      or the cardiovascular system. It is estimated that about 1000 g of C-C-2W, even
      if spread, are beyond the limit of human tolerance.

TI  - Transformation of chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid by human
      intestinal bacteria.
PG  - 1068-73
AB  - Feces from normal subjects and patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis were 
      incubated anaerobically with labeled chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholine
      acid for known periods, and the bile acids formed were analyzed by TLC and
      scintillation counting. In the normal subjects, 80% of the chenodeoxycholic acid 
      and 41% of the ursodeoxycholic acid were 7-dehydroxylated to lithocholic acid
      during 2 hr of incubation. In contrast, the fecal flora of the CTX patients
      transformed only 5% of chenodeoxycholic acid and less than 1% of ursodeoxycholic 
      acid to lithocholic acid during the same time period. In several subjects
      (normals and CTX), the intestinal flora converted chenodeoxycholic acid to
      ursodeoxycholic acid without the accumulation of the hypothetical intermediate
      7-ketolithocholic acid (3 alpha-hydroxy-7-keto-5 beta-cholanoic acid). These
      results indicate that the fecal bacterial flora is capable of 7-dehydroxylating
      chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid to yield lithocholic acid.
      Apparently the enzymes involved are relatively stereospecific since the 7
      beta-hydroxy group of ursodeoxycholic acid was removed more slowly than the 7
      alpha-hydroxy group of chenodeoxycholic acid.

TI  - Peripheral neuropathy in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 880-1
AB  - Four patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) underwent
      electrophysiologic investigations, which demonstrated impairment in the
      functioning of the peripheral nerves in all four cases. The changes consisted of 
      slow motor and sensory conduction. The changes were most marked in the older
      subjects, in whom the disease was more advanced, and who also had clinical
      manifestations of mild peripheral neuropathy. We conclude that the peripheral
      nerves are damaged in CTX.

AB  - The absolute configuration of the C27 pentahydroxy bile alcohol present in bile
      and feces of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) was

      spectra of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol in the
      presence of Eu (fod) 3[tris (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3-hepta fluoro-7,
      7-dimethyl-octane-4, 6-dionato) europium (III)] exhibited a large induced split
      Cotton effect at ca. 310 nm. From the induced circular dichroism of 5
      beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 23, 25-pentol with Eu(fod) 3 it was
      concluded that the CTX bile alcohol has the 1, 3 glycol structure with carbon 23 
      having the R configuration. This information will be useful in elucidating a
      structural mechanism for the conversion of 5 beta-cholestranepentols into bile
      acids in man and rat.

TI  - Cholic acid biosynthesis: the enzymatic defect in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - Cholic acid biosynthesis is defective in individuals with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) and is associated with the excretion of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,25-tetrol, an intermediate in the
      25-hydroxylation pathway of cholic acid in CTX. To define the enzymatic defect in
      CTX, two suspected precursors of cholic acid, namely
      5beta-[7beta-(3)H]cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha-triol and
      5beta-[24-(14)C]cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,24S,25-pentol were examined by 
      both in vivo and in vitro experiments. A third precursor,
      5beta-[7beta-(3)H]-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,25-tetrol, was compared with
      them in vitro. In the in vivo experiments, each one of the labeled precursors was
      administered intravenously to two CTX and two control subjects. In the controls, 
      5beta-[7beta-(3)H]cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha-triol as well as
      5beta-[24-(14)C]-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,24S,25-pentol were rapidly
      converted to labeled cholic acid. Maximum specific activity values were reached
      within 1 d after pulse labeling, followed by exponential decay of the cholic acid
      specific activity curves. In contrast, these two precursors differed widely when 
      administered to two CTX patients. While 5beta-[24-(14)C]cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,
      12alpha,24S,25-pentol was rapidly converted to [24-(14)C]cholic acid and yielded 
      identical decay curves with those obtained in the control subjects, maximum
      specific activity values in [7beta-(3)H]cholic acid were much lower and peaked
      only on the second day after the injection of
      5beta-[7beta-(3)H]cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha-triol. Furthermore, an
      appreciable amount of (3)H label was present in the
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,25-tetrol isolated from the bile of the
      subjects with CTX. In the in vitro experiments, three enzymes on the
      25-hydroxylation pathway of cholic acid were examined in both control and CTX
      subjects. The rate of the 25-hydroxylation of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,
      12alpha-triol in CTX patients was comparable to that in the controls. Similarly, 
      the transformation of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,24S,25-pentol to
      cholic acid, catalyzed by soluble enzymes, proceeded at approximately equal rates
      in CTX and in control individuals. On the other hand, the rate of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,24S,25-pentol formation was about four
      times greater in the control subjects than in the CTX patients.The results of the
      in vivo as well as the in vitro experiments suggest that the site of the
      enzymatic defect in CTX is at the 24S-hydroxylation of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha,25-tetrol. The relative deficiency of
      this hydroxylase in CTX patients, accompanied by the accumulation of its
      substrate in bile and feces, probably accounts for the subnormal production of
      bile acids in CTX patients.

PG  - 22-30
AB  - In patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), diminished cholic acid
      production is associated with incomplete oxidation of the cholesterol side chain 
      and the excretion of C(25)-hydroxy bile alcohols. The aims of this investigation 
      were 1) to provide quantitative information on the pool size and production rate 
      of chenodeoxycholic acid by the isotope dilution technique; and 2) to investigate
      the possible existence of a block in chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis and explain 
      the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid precursors in CTX. After the injection of
      [24-(14)C]chenodeoxycholic acid, measurements of chenodeoxycholic acid pool size 
      and production rate in a CTX subject were, respectively, 1/20 and 1/6 as great as
      controls. Further, three potential precursors of chenodeoxycholic acid, namely
      [G-(3)H]7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one,
      [G-(3)H]5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,25-triol, and
      [G-(3)H]5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,26-triol, were administered to the CTX and
      control subjects and the specific activity curves of [G-(3)H]cholic acid and
      [G-(3)H]chenodeoxycholic acid were constructed and compared. In the control
      subjects, the two bile acids decayed exponentially, but in the CTX patient
      maximum specific activities were abnormally delayed, indicating the hindered
      transformation of precursor into bile acid. These results show that
      chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis is small in CTX and that the conversion of
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,25-triol, and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,26-triol to both chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic 
      acid were similarly impaired.

PG  - 187-90
AB  - The absolute configurations of the C27 pentahydroxy bile alcohols present in bile
      and feces of two patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) were
      determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectra of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24alpha,25-pentol in the presence of
      Eu(fod)3 [tris(1,1,1,2,2,3,3-heptafluoro-7,7-dimethyloctane-4,6-dionato) europium
      (III)] exhibited a negative Cotton effect and was assigned to 24R absolute
      configuration. Conversely,
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24beta,25-pentol showed a strong positive 
      Cotton effect and was assigned the 24S configuration. These assignments were
      based upon comparison with a model compound, 5-cholestene-3beta,24(R),25-triol,
      whose single-crystal X-ray structure has been determined. The importance of these
      data is to establish a structural mechanism for the conversion of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24S,25-pentol rather than
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24R,25-pentol into cholic acid in man as
      well as in animals.

      endoplasmic reticulum and occasionally free floating in the cytosol. The chemical
      nature of these inclusions has not yet been determined. However, the accumulation
      of such material may indicate the presence of nonmetabolizable bile alcohols
      resulting from a defect in bile acid synthesis.

TI  - Evidence for the early reduction of the 24,25 double bond in the conversion of
      lanosterol to cholesterol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 721-9
AB  - The metabolism of lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (DL) was examined in a
      patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis after intravenous pulse labeling with
      a mixture of DL-2-14C and 3S,4S,3R,4R-(4-3H)mevalonate. Sterols were isolated
      from the feces and purified by silver nitrate thin-layer chromatography, and
      their identities were confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography and mass
      spectrometry. Their specific activities were then determined and plotted as a
      function of time. These isotope ratio measurements and specific activity decay
      curves were consistent with 24,25-dihydrolanosterol and delta7-cholestenol being 
      intermediates in the synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate and lanosterol, and
      they suggested that reduction of the lanosterol side chain may occur as an early 
      step in the synthesis of cholesterol. These results are in contrast to the
      results reported after the administration of triparanol, a delta24-reductase
      inhibitor.

TI  - Cerebrotendinous cholestanolosis in relation to other cerebral xanthomatoses.
PG  - 253-72
AB  - A synopsis is given of 37 reported patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; 
      divided in 11 possible, but not proven cases of C.T.Ch (cerebrotendinous
      cholestanolosis), and 26 proven cases. An increased content of cholestanol in
      serum or tissue, was used as the main criterion. The ophthalmological and
      neurological signs are tabulated. Attention is drawn to the fact that cholestanol
      is not mentioned in the extensive literature on related diseases with possible
      cerebrospinal xanthomas, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis and
      hyperlipoproteinemia. The importance of a possible role of cholestanol in these
      diseases is stressed. A hypothetical form of cerebrotendinous cholesterolosis is 
      discussed. A family with a sibship of parents and twelve children, three of which
      showed C.T.Ch is described. The development of the clinical picture confirmed the
      variable expression of the autosomal recessive disease. Two patients showed
      disturbances of steroid metabolism. A first contribution to the search for
      linkage with the H.L.A. system is presented. Cholestanol over cholesterol ratio, 
      appeared to be independent of the type of lipoprotein. In search for therapy we
      found in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type II A, that cholestyramine alone 
      gave dangerously high blood levels of cholestanol; in combined treatment of
      cholestyramine with clofibrate cholestanol, levels were comparable to those of
      the controls. The possibilities of therapy are discussed.

TI  - Quantitative determination of cholestanol in plasma with mass fragmentography.
      Biochemical diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 223-8
AB  - A simple, sensitive, and accurate method for determination of cholestanol in
      plasma is described. In this method a fixed amount of cholestane is added to 1 ml
      of plasma as an internal standard and steroids are saponified and extracted with 
      n-hexane. The amounts of cholestanol and cholesterol are determined by mass
      fragmentography by monitoring the intensities of m/e 306, m/e 329, and m/e 372
      fragment ions. The relative standard deviation of results for cholestanol was
      about 6.3%. The cholestanol concentrations in the plasma, erythrocyte stroma, and
      plasma lipoproteins of three patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis were
      determined by this method.

TI  - A 25-hydroxylation pathway of cholic acid biosynthesis in man and rat.
PG  - 897-903
AB  - This paper describes a pathway of cholic acid synthesis, in man and in the rat,
      which involves 25-hydroxylated intermediates and is catalyzed by microsomal and
      soluble enzymes. The subcellular localization, stereospecificity, and other
      properties of the enzymes involved were studied with liver fractions of
      normolipidemic subjects, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis patients, and rats.
      5beta-Cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol was converted to
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24beta,25-pentol by the microsomal
      fraction in the presence of NADPH and O2.
      5beta-Cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24alpha,25-pentol,
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,-23xi,25-pentol, and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25,26-pentol were also formed. In the
      presence of NAD, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24beta,25-pentol, but not
      the other 5beta-cholestanepentols formed, was converted to cholic acid by soluble
      enzymes in good yield. These experiments demonstrate the existence of a pathway
      for side-chain degradation in cholic acid synthesis which does not involve
      hydroxylation at C-26 or the participation of mitochondria.

      characterization of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 24xi, 25-pentol and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 23xi, 25-pentol.
PG  - 280-6
AB  - This paper describes studies dealing with the nature of the C27 pentahydroxy bile
      alcohols present in the bile and feces of two patients with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX). The presence of a bile alcohol having the structure
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24alpha,25-pentol was confirmed by
      separation of the two 24-hydroxy epimers of
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24,25-pentol and characterization of the
      dpimers by gas-liquid chromatography and infrared and mass spectrometry.
      Tentative assignment of the 24alpha and 24beta configuration was made on the
      basis of molecular rotation differences. A second major bile alcohol excreted by 
      the CTX subjects was 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,23xi,25-pentol. Its
      structure was determined by infrared spectrometry, proton magnetic resonance
      spectrometry, and mass spectrometry because a reference compound was not
      available.

PG  - 226-31
AB  - To study the role of C25-HYDROXY BILE ALCOHOLS AS PRECURSORS OF CHOlic acid,
      [G-3-H]5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha12alpha,25-tetrol was administered
      intravenously to two subjects with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and two
      normal individuals. One day after pulse labeling, radioactivity was present in
      the cholic acid isolated from the bile and feces of the subjects with CTX and the
      bile of the normal individuals. In the two normal subjects, the sp act decay
      curves of [G-3-H]-cholic acid were exponential, and no traces of
      [G-3-H]-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol were detected. In
      contrast, appreciable quantities of labeled
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,-7aopha,12alpha,25-tetrol were present in the bile and
      feces of the CTX subjects. The sp act vs. time curves of fecal
      [G-3-H]5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol and [G-3-H]-cholic acid
      showed a precursor-product relationship. Although these results suggest that
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol may be a precursor of cholic
      acid in man, the possibility that C26-hydroxy intermediates represent the normal 
      pathway can not be excluded.

      described. The most important clinical findings were xanthomas, central nervous
      affection with motor and mental dysfunction, EEG changes and juvenile cataract.
      The diagnosis was established by the demonstration of increased amounts of
      cholestanol in serum. Both sisters had amenorrhea, and their excretion of
      dehydroepiandrosterone in the urine was increased. In the elder sister, the
      levels of urinary 17-keto steroids, androsterone and estradiol were also
      increased. Other unusual features of the disease in the elder sister were
      hyper-prebeta-lipoproteinemia and serum cholesterol in the higher normal range.

AB  - Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis occurred in a new family. This is a rare familial 
      disorder characterized by juvenile cataracts, enlargement of tendons, low
      intelligence, and a variable neurological syndrome with cerebellar ataxia as the 
      most prominent feature. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The basic
      defect remains obscure, but recent investigations have shown an excess of
      cholestanol in the tissues and serum of affected persons, which forms the basis
      of diagnosis.

TI  - Transformation of 5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol to cholesterol and cholestanol
      in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 256-62
AB  - The metabolism of Delta(7)-cholestenol, cholesterol, and cholestanol was examined
      in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis after intravenous pulse-labeling
      with a mixture of dl-[2-(14)C]mevalonate and stereospecific
      3S,4S,3R,4R-[4-(3)H]mevalonate. Silver nitrate and reversed-phase thin-layer
      chromatography were used to purify the sterols isolated from the feces, and their
      identities were confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The
      specific activities were determined and plotted as a function of time. Isotope
      ratio measurements and specific activity decay curves showed that sterol
      synthesis proceeded in the following sequence: mevalonate, squalene, lanosterol, 
      Delta(7)-cholestenol, cholesterol, cholestanol. Labeled cholesterol precursors
      might be advantageously used to measure changes in cholesterol synthesis because 
      they appear to equilibrate rapidly and have very short turnover times.

TI  - A biochemical abnormality in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Impairment of bile
      acid biosynthesis associated with incomplete degradation of the cholesterol side 
      chain.
PG  - 1393-401
AB  - Bile acid production in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is subnormal, yet
      the activity of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-determining enzyme of
      bile acid synthesis, is elevated. To explain this discrepancy, bile acid
      precursors were sought in bile and feces of three CTX subjects. Over 10% of the
      total sterols excreted in bile and feces consisted of compounds more polar than
      cholesterol. Chromatographic analysis of the polar fractions in conjunction with 
      gasliquid chromatography (GLC)-mass spectrometry indicated two major
      constituents, 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,25-tetrol and
      5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24xi,25-pentol. After i.v. injection of
      [4-(14)C]cholesterol both bile alcohols were radioactive proving that they were
      derived from cholesterol. The accumulation of alcohols hydroxylated at C-25 and
      C-24,25 suggests that decreased bile acid synthesis in CTX results from impaired 
      oxidation of the cholesterol side chain. This finding and the virtual absence of 
      intermediates hydroxylated at C-26 indicate that current views of the major
      pathway of bile acid synthesis may require revision.

TI  - Increased formation of ursodeoxycholic acid in patients treated with
      chenodeoxycholic acid.
PG  - 612-21
AB  - The formation of ursodeoxycholic acid, the 7 beta-hydroxy epimer of
      chenodeoxycholic acid, was investigated in three subjects with cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis and in four subjects with gallstones. Total biliary bile acid
      composition was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography before and after 4 months
      of treatment with 0.75 g/day of chenodeoxycholic acid. Individual bile acids were
      identified by mass spectrometry. Before treatment, bile from cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis (CTX) subjects contained cholic acid, 85%; chenodeoxycholic acid,
      7%; deoxycholic acid, 3%; allocholic acid, 3%; and unidentified steroids, 2%;
      while bile from gallstone subjects contained cholic acid, 45%; chenodeoxycholic
      acid, 43%; deoxycholic acid, 11%, and lithocholic acid, 1%. In all subjects, 4
      months of chenodeoxycholic acid therapy increased the proportion of this bile
      acid to approximately 80% and decreased cholic acid to 3% of the total biliary
      bile acids, the remaining 17% of bile acids were identified as ursodeoxycholic
      acid. After the intravenous injection of [3H]chenodeoxycholic acid, the specific 
      activity of biliary ursodeoxycholic acid exceeded the specific activity of
      chenodeoxycholic acid, and the resulting specific activity decay curves suggested
      precursor-product relationships. When [3H]7-ketolithocholic acid was
      administrated to another patient treated with chenodeoxycholic acid,
      radioactivity was detected in both the ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic 
      acid fractions. These results indicate that substantial amounts of
      ursodeoxycholic acid are formed in patients treated with chenodeoxycholic acid.
      The ursodeoxycholic acid was synthesized from chenodeoxycholic acid presumably
      via 7-ketolithocholic acid.

TI  - The metabolism of cholestanol, cholesterol, and bile acids in cerebrotendinous
      xanthomatosis.
PG  - 2822-35
AB  - The metabolism of cholesterol and its 5-dihydro derivative, cholestanol, was
      investigated by means of sterol balance and isotope kinetic techniques in 3
      subjects with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and 11 other individuals. All 
      subjects were hospitalized on a metabolic ward and were fed diets practically
      free of cholesterol and cholestanol. After the intravenous administration of
      [1,2-(3)H]cholestanol, the radioactive sterol was transported and esterified in
      plasma lipoproteins in an identical manner to cholesterol. In these short-term
      experiments, the specific activity-time curves of plasma cholestanol conformed to
      two-pool models in both the CTX and control groups. However, cholestanol plasma
      concentrations, total body miscible pools, and daily synthesis rates were two to 
      five times greater in the CTX than control individuals. The short-term specific
      activity decay curves of plasma [4-(14)C]cholesterol also conformed to two-pool
      models in both groups. However, in the CTX subjects the decay was more rapid, and
      daily cholesterol synthesis was nearly double that of the control subjects.
      Plasma concentrations and the sizes of the rapidly turning over pool of
      exchangeable cholesterol were apparently small in the CTX subjects, and these
      measurements did not correlate with the large cholesterol deposits found in
      tendon and tuberous xanthomas. Despite active cholesterol synthesis, bile acid
      formation was subnormal in the CTX subjects. However, bile acid sequestration was
      accompanied by a rise in plasma cholestanol levels and greatly augmented fecal
      cholestanol outputs. In contrast, the administration of clofibrate lowered plasma
      cholesterol levels 50% and presumably reduced synthesis in the CTX subjects.
      Plasma cholesterol concentrations and fecal steroid excretion did not change
      significantly during this therapy. These findings indicate that the excessive
      tissue deposits of cholesterol and cholestanol that characterize CTX were
      associated with hyperactive neutral sterol synthesis. The demonstration of
      subnormal bile acid formation suggests that defective bile acid synthesis may
      predispose to the neutral sterol abnormalities.

TI  - Biosynthesis of 5 -cholestan-3 -ol in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
PG  - 134-40
AB  - Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis is a rare, inherited disease characterized by an
      extraordinary accumulation of cholestanol in all tissues, xanthomatous deposits
      in the brain, lungs, and Achilles tendons, premature atherosclerosis, and low
      plasma cholesterol concentrations. In two patients with the disease, the
      biosynthesis of cholestanol was examined by different techniques. After
      cholesterol-4-(14)C was injected intravenously into one patient, cholestanol and 
      cholesterol isolated from the bile on 3 different days over the ensuing week
      contained significant radioactivity. The specific radioactivity-time curves for
      cholesterol-(14)C and cholestanol-(14)C suggested a precursor product
      relationship and provided additional evidence for the transformation of
      cholesterol into cholestanol. The second patient received intravenously a mixture
      of mevalonate-2-(14)C and stereospecifically labeled mevalonate-3R,4R-(3)H. Again
      cholesterol and cholestanol were isolated from the bile, and the (3)H/(14)C ratio
      in both sterols was almost the same. This experiment again demonstrated that the 
      biosynthetic path of cholestanol proceeded through cholesterol and not directly
      from earlier 5alpha-H-saturated precursors. These two independent lines of
      evidence indicate that the extraordinary deposition of cholestanol in
      Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis arises from cholesterol presumably through the
      accentuation of the normal biosynthetic pathway.

Sickle hemoglobin (Hb S;betaGlu 6 Val) is due to an A&gt;T transversion in codon 6 of the beta-globin gene. Other variant hemoglobins mimic Hb A, S, or C on newborn screening and clinical laboratory diagnostic tools, thus making their correct identification potentially difficult. Sickling disorders can result in individuals who are compound heterozygous for beta-globin mutations (e.g., Hb SC, HbSO(Arab)). The authors report a second case of HbS/Qu√©bec-CHORI, a severe compound heterozygous sickling disorder and their experience managing this patient with hydroxyurea.
